# Additional Introduction {#sec-append-dgdm}

## Science Plan Organization

The RWSC Subcommittees are using several categories to organize information about ongoing, pending, and recommended data collection and research.

### Chapters: Marine wildlife taxa, habitats, and cross-taxa issues

First, the Science Plan is separated into chapters that align with each RWSC taxa-based Subcommittee: Marine Mammals, Birds & Bats, Sea Turtles, Protected Fish Species, and Habitat & Ecosystem. 
The Habitat & Ecosystem Subcommittee wrote two chapters: Oceanography and Seafloor Habitat.
There are additional chapters for issues that relate to all taxa and habitats, including Science Plan Actions, Data Standardization & Management, Data Governance, and Technology.

There are many data collection activities that explicitly target or incidentally gather information on multiple taxa.
Those multi-taxa activities are described in the [RWSC Offshore Wind & Wildlife Research Database](https://database.rwsc.org/) and in the pertinent sections of the Science Plan.
Opportunities for additional coordinated data collection across taxa are also described in each section where relevant.

### Subregions

Each taxa-based chapter of the Science Plan groups information about ongoing, pending, and recommended research activities by whether they occur at the regional scale (U.S. Atlantic waters) or at subregional scales.
The Subcommittees identified Subregions roughly aligned with the current federal offshore wind development planning and lease areas (see figure below).
This alignment stems from the reality that many data collection activities are funded to examine a particular project overall, a project phase, lease area, or group of contiguous lease areas. 

The use of subregions in the Science Plan is limited to organizing information and highlighting place-based gaps and needs.
It is not the intent of the Science Plan to suggest geographic boundaries for data collection and research activities.
In many cases, biogeographic considerations may drive data collection and research planning, including study design, analysis, and interpretation.

## Research Themes

For the purposes of organizing hundreds of ongoing, pending, and recommended research activities along the Atlantic coast, the Subcommittees used five broad Research Themesto organize their chapters.
There are more specific research topics, questions, and recommendations that nest within each theme.
Some research topics and recommendations relate to more than one Research Theme.

In the [RWSC Offshore Wind & Wildlife Research Database](https://database.rwsc.org/), users can filter ongoing data collection and research activities by Research Theme.

### Improving mitigation of negative impacts that are likely to occur and/or are severe in magnitude

Several Subcommittee members identified this research theme as a high priority overall, particularly for highly vulnerable and/or protected species that are data limited.
Research within this theme would test the efficacy of existing mitigation methods or develop new methods for high-risk species for which there is high confidence in negative impacts. 

### Detecting and quantifying changes to wildlife and habitats

This theme encompasses the work required to detect and quantify changes to wildlife distribution, abundance, behavior, and health as well as changes to habitat characteristics and quality.
The Subcommittees recognize that not all observed changes are ecologically meaningful, and that consideration should be given to determining and defining levels of change that are meaningful for various ecosystem components or species.
Activities within this theme include but are not limited to:

-   Collecting baseline wildlife and habitat data 

-   Assessing whether sufficient wildlife, habitat, and ecosystem data exist to detect change 

-   Designing and conducting assessments of effects or impacts to wildlife and habitats 

-   Developing and testing new technologies and tools to improve wildlife- and habitat-observational capacity 

-   Other approaches to reduce uncertainty in observed wildlife/habitat patterns 

-   Identifying thresholds of ecologically meaningful change

### Understanding the environmental context around changes to wildlife and habitats

When paired with the activities associated with the previous research theme, characterizations of the environmental context including anthropogenic stressors, will be critical for understanding drivers of wildlife, habitat, and ecosystem change.
Activities within this theme include characterizations of oceanographic and meteorological properties, prey fields, ocean noise, and human activities in the ocean other than offshore wind that may affect wildlife and habitat.
An important component of this research theme is controlling for impacts induced by climate change during the assessment of potential offshore wind effects. 

### Determining causality for observed changes to wildlife and habitats

Ideally, research activities result in the ability to determine the causes of any observed changes to wildlife distribution, abundance, and/or behavior, and to habitats.
Given the natural variability in the ocean ecosystem and new patterns and variations attributed to climate change, Subcommittee members have cautioned that determining causality with high confidence will be challenging.

### Enhancing data sharing and access

This theme is a catalyst for addressing all the previous themes.
Activities within this theme include:

-   Identifying and supporting existing data systems or building and maintaining new data systems that accommodate the volumes of wildlife and environmental data to be collected over the next several decades

-   Developing the institutional support for and frameworks needed to facilitate timely data sharing

-   Developing standards for data sharing, management, storage, and access for various data types and methods/tools
