# Marine Mammals {#sec-append-mm}

## Introduction 

This chapter leverages ongoing data collection and research initiatives related to offshore wind and marine mammals funded by a variety of partners (states, federal agencies, industry).
For an always up-to-date list of active projects, visit the [RWSC Offshore Wind & Wildlife Research Database](https://database.rwsc.org/). 
 

Given this ongoing work, the Marine Mammal Subcommittee is making recommendations for additional research that is both aligned with existing efforts and that fills important gaps. 

## Focal Marine mammal species and recent trends in the RWSC study area 

Marine mammals include baleen whales and toothed whales (together, cetaceans), seals (pinnipeds), and manatees (sirenians).
Distributions of marine mammals have been shifting in response to changes in their environment, including human activities, climate change, and conservation measures.
For a current list of marine mammal species and their status in the RWSC study area, visit the NOAA Fisheries Species Directory at <https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/species-directory/> and apply filters for "New England/Mid-Atlantic" and "Southeast". 

All marine mammal species are protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) which prohibits intentional or incidental killing, injuring, or harassment of marine mammals and specifies the circumstances and rules under which permits may be issued for such activities.
Under the MMPA, NOAA Fisheries has developed [stock assessment reports](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/marine-mammal-protection/marine-mammal-stock-assessments) for all marine mammals in U.S. waters since 1994.
These reports contain estimates of current species population sizes and population trends.
Six marine mammal species are also listed as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), which prohibits "take" of these species and requires conservation of their habitat.
In addition to stock assessment reports, NOAA Fisheries generates authoritative and up-to-date information on marine mammal status and trends via the following webpages: 

-   [Marine Mammal Unusual Mortality Event](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/marine-mammal-protection/marine-mammal-unusual-mortality-events)

-   [NOAA Fisheries Protected Species Surveys](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/science-data/protected-species-surveys)

-   [Marine Mammal Health and Stranding Response Program](#0) 

Environmental Impact Statements (EISs) associated with the U.S.
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review of offshore wind projects provide detailed descriptions of the affected environment, impact analysis, and cumulative effects.
Each proposed offshore wind project's Final EIS should be considered an important reference for focal marine mammal species, recent trends, habitat considerations, and potential impacts.
Final EISs are posted to BOEM's website. 

From a regional and global perspective, natural and anthropogenic climate change are recognized as major drivers of changes in marine mammal distribution, and in some cases, abundance as well [@chavez-rosales2022; @ganley2022; @meyer-gutbrod2022; @pendelton2022; @thorne2022].
Baleen whales' prey in particular-- which include zooplankton and small fish species--are susceptible to ocean warming and changes in ocean circulation.
In response to climate-driven shifts in their prey, baleen whales have shifted foraging locations into places where fewer protections are available [@davies2019], or where conflicts with more human uses are likely.
NOAA's 2023 State of the Ecosystem New England report [@lucey2023] describes the slow movement of several marine mammal species to the northeast and into generally deeper water [@chavez-rosales2022] (and see figure below).

The following data products and tools provide relevant context to inform where new data collection is needed and which research questions are most urgent to address given present status and trends in marine mammal distribution, abundance, behavior as observed in the field or understood by the most recent analyses.
These sources are updated frequently.

[**Habitat-based Marine Mammal Density Models for the U.S. Atlantic:**](https://seamap.env.duke.edu/models/Duke/EC/)The Duke Marine Geospatial Ecology Laboratory leads an ongoing collaboration of federal, state, academic, and independent research organizations who pool scientific data and expertise to develop marine mammal species density models spanning the U.S. east coast and southeast Canada.

[**Passive Acoustic Cetacean Map:**](https://apps-nefsc.fisheries.noaa.gov/pacm/#/) This map shows when and where specific whale, dolphin, and other cetacean species were acoustically detected in the North Atlantic Ocean based on Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM).
The dataset was compiled by the NOAA NEFSC Passive Acoustic Research Program using detection data collected by many collaborators.

[**WhaleMap**](https://whalemap.org/WhaleMap/)**:** Designed to communicate the latest whale survey results to scientific, regulatory, and industrial sectors to inform more effective, dynamic planning of research and conservation activities.
The map is synchronized with data repositories from several different survey groups such that results are reported in near-real time.

[**Whale Alert app**](https://www.whalealert.org/)**:** Launched in 2012 as a citizen science tool aimed at reducing the risk of vessel strikes.
The free app uses whale presence data including verified sightings, acoustic detections from buoys and gliders, and aerial surveys to display a user-friendly map based on nautical charts from country-specific government agencies.

**Right Whale Seasonal Management Areas & Dynamic Management Areas (Slow Zones):** Seasonal Management Areas (SMAs) for North Atlantic right whales are zones and times of year when all vessels 65 feet or longer must travel at 10 knots or less to reduce the threat of vessel collisions[^append-mm-1].
Dynamic Management Areas (DMAs) are trigged when groups of whales are sighted outside of active SMAs.
NOAA Fisheries has proposed several modifications to North Atlantic right whale vessel speed regulations which will likely take effect in 2024.
Please check NOAA's website for updated information: <https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/endangered-species-conservation/reducing-vessel-strikes-north-atlantic-right-whales#current-vessel-speed-restrictions>.

**Biologically Important Areas (BIAs) for Cetaceans within U.S. Waters:** BIAs represent areas and times in which cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises) are known to concentrate for activities related to reproduction, feeding, and migration, as well as the known ranges of small and resident populations [@noaacetsound2015].
Updated descriptions and maps for U.S.
East Coast BIAs are not yet available (as of October 2023) but will be incorporated by reference once they are published [@harrison2023].

**Prey and habitat data:** Marine mammal prey species (e.g., zooplankton, forage fish) are driven by oceanographic factors and in turn drive mammal distribution, abundance, and behavior.
Recent studies of hydrodynamic and oceanographic factors that are impacted by climate change and may also change due to the introduction of offshore wind structures summarize key issues and data gaps:

### Potential effects with respect to offshore wind

As migratory species, many marine mammals\' ranges overlap the areas proposed for offshore wind development in the Atlantic Ocean.
In addition, most marine mammal species are exposed to many other types of stressors in these areas.
The cumulative effect of several stressors may create a biologically significant population level response [@kraus2019a].

Of the large whale species listed in Table 1 that are of greatest concern, baleen whales have typically been prioritized for attention with respect to offshore wind research [@southall2021a], due to their distribution and abundance in the study area, behavior, and life history characteristics that make them susceptible to some of the specific stressors potentially associated with offshore wind.
That being said, the majority of studies describing the effects of construction and operation of windfarms on cetaceans come from Europe, where small odontocetes (dolphins and porpoise mainly) are the most common cetaceans.
Avoidance and displacement effects, at ranges up to 10-26 km from the whole footprint of offshore windfarms during construction have been reported [@benhemmalegall2021; @brandt2016; @brandt2018; @dähne2013; @dähne2017; @graham2019; @graham2023]. 
These studies indicate that the distance and duration of avoidance is related to received noise, which is further influenced by source level, sound propagation conditions, hearing range of the studied species, distance to the noise source, duration of exposure, level and type of mitigation and presence of other noise sources like construction vessels.
There is variation among studies in the time reported for animal behaviour to return to pre-construction levels, from hours [@dähne2017a] and days [@brandt2018a] to years [@teilmann2012], which also suggest that operation of offshore windfarms may also affect cetacean behavior.
Tagging data from Europe around wind energy sites suggest that harbor and grey seals either habituate quickly or may take advantage of the wind farm physical structures as a foraging opportunity [@russell2016].

Kraus et al. 2019 summarized the potential short-term and long-term effects of offshore wind development on marine mammals and sea turtles in Massachusetts and Rhode Island Wind Energy Areas.
The list of potential effects below from this report is relevant to the entire RWSC study area.
Any concerns related to marine mammal species that are specific to each subregion will be further described in the following sections of this chapter.

Overall, climate change increases the uncertainty surrounding marine mammal behavior, distribution and demography, which can abruptly and unexpectedly increases the risks associated with offshore wind development if marine mammals begin to use new areas and habitats or existing habitat more frequently or during different times of year.

**Potential short-term effects of offshore wind construction activities**

Potential short-term effects include noise from pile driving, vessel operating noise, and the increased vessel activity to/from and near turbine fields.
These stressors could influence:

-   Displacement of marine mammals from wind energy areas

-   Increased risk of vessel strike

-   Disruption to critical behaviors of marine mammals such as feeding, socializing, or nursing

-   Elevation of stress hormone levels in marine mammals

-   Changes in vertical distribution, density, or patch structure of zooplankton and/or fish prey

**Potential long-term effects of offshore wind operation**

Potential long-term effects include wind turbine presence, and increased vessel activity to/from and near turbine fields.
These stressors could influence:

-   Marine mammal exclusion from or attraction to wind energy areas

-   Increased risk of vessel strike

-   Changes to feeding opportunities

-   Enhancements to marine productivity due to artificial reef effect around wind turbine foundations

-   Increased risk of entanglement from abandoned, lost, or otherwise discarded fishing gear attached to underwater offshore wind structures
