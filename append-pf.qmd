# Protected Fish Species {#sec-append-pf}

This chapter leverages ongoing data collection and research initiatives related to offshore wind and protected fish species funded by a variety of partners (states, federal agencies, industry).
For an always up-to-date list of active projects, visit the [RWSC Offshore Wind & Wildlife Research Database](https://database.rwsc.org/).
Given this ongoing work, as well as previous research on Protected Fish Species and their interactions with wind energy areas in Europe and the United States, the Protected Fish Species Subcommittee is making recommendations for additional research that is both aligned with existing efforts and fills important gaps.

## Background

Marine fish are very diverse.
They occupy a wide variety of habitats; have different anatomical features and unique life histories.
In the United States, marine fish are managed at both the federal and state levels, depending on where the species most commonly occurs.
Regional fishery management councils and NOAA Fisheries federally manage species that predominantly occur in ocean waters beyond the state jurisdictional limit (three nautical miles).
The four regional fishery management councils responsible for managing most federal fisheries in the U.S. waters of the Atlantic Ocean include the New England Fishery Management Council (NEFMC), the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council (MAFMC), the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council (SAFMC), and the Caribbean Fishery Management Council (CFMC).
These regional fishery management councils are responsible for developing federal fishery management plans, regulations, and designating Essential Fish Habitat (EFH), while NOAA Fisheries is responsible for approving and implementing those plans, regulations, or Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) designations.
This is not the case for highly migratory species (HMS), which are managed through NOAA Fisheries Atlantic Highly Migratory Species Management Division within the Office of Sustainable Fisheries.
This division develops the fisheries management plans (FMPs) and designates EFH for HMS within the FMPs and regulations.
NOAA Fisheries and the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) are the lead federal agencies for implementation of The Endangered Species Act (ESA), which provides a framework to conserve and protect endangered and threatened species and their habitats.
Marine species that predominately occur in nearshore or estuarine waters are typically managed by the individual states, while the ASMFC oversees the management of fish species for which there is an interstate management plan.
All federal and state agencies responsible for fishery management work in coordination with, and collect input from, other federal partners, state partners, tribal governments, academia, industry, and non-governmental organizations.

The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) is responsible for managing the development of energy on the outer continental shelf.
BOEM produces Environmental Impact Statements (EISs) or Environmental Assessments (EAs) under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) for each offshore wind project.
These documents are intended to thoroughly assess the potential impacts on protected fish, both from the individual project, and cumulatively (to include potential impacts from offshore wind development and all other potentially impactful activities).
BOEM is also required to complete an EFH Consultation under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSA) for all activities that may affect areas of designated habitat where federally managed fish spawn, breed, feed, or grow to maturity.

Fish distribution in a marine environment is influenced by a variety of factors and is known to vary seasonally and over time.
Spatiotemporal distributions and migration corridors do not just vary by species, but also by contingent/population within a given species.
Water temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen levels, food availability, habitat structure/substrate type, and harvest all play major roles in where species are found.
As a whole, fish are sensitive to changes in the environment and thus are subject to the impacts of shifting ocean conditions.
Climate change, among other anthropogenic stressors, has altered the distribution of many fish species, and is projected to continue to affect fish distribution [@hare2016; @noaafisheries2022b].
NOAA Fisheries conducted a climate vulnerability assessment on 82 fish and invertebrate species in the U.S.
Northeast, and determined that of the fish studied, diadromous species exhibit the highest level of vulnerability to climate change induced environmental changes [@hare2016].
Atlantic sturgeon, shortnose sturgeon, and Atlantic salmon are all diadromous protected fish species located in the RWSC study area. 
Anthropogenic activity such as commercial and recreational fishing, coastal development, pollution, and climate change each contribute to habitat alterations, and thus changing fish distributions.
Offshore wind development will spark additional changes to many aspects of the ecosystem, and is likely to hasten certain biological changes including fish distributions. 
 

For the purposes of this document, protected fish will include all species that are listed as Endangered, Threatened, petitioned, candidate, or proposed under the Endangered Species Act.
Under the ESA, some species are broken up into Distinct Population Segments (DPS), which are defined as a vertebrate population or group of populations that is discrete from other populations of the species and significant in relation to the entire species.
According to the ESA, it is prohibited to take each of these species, and all Federal departments and agencies must seek to protect and conserve listed species and their habitats [@lawsp].
Fish species listed under ESA are already in a vulnerable state, so are at an even greater risk with respect to anthropogenic impacts and changes to the environment.
Therefore, these protected fish species may also be more susceptible to effects from offshore wind development.
The subcommittee notes that while this plan focuses on protected fish species, there is also concern about the impacts of offshore wind development on other, non-ESA Listed fish species that overlap with offshore wind development in the western Atlantic.

In considering species for inclusion in this chapter, the Subcommittee explored other protected fish listings and other organizations involved in offshore wind and fisheries research where our efforts might overlap.
The Responsible Offshore Science Alliance (ROSA) is an organization analogous to RWSC that advances research and monitoring on the potential effects of offshore wind on fisheries in the RWSC study area.
While both RWSC and ROSA are engaging in regional coordination and advancement of research and monitoring related to interactions between offshore wind and ecosystems, ROSA’s focus is fisheries (commercial and recreational) and RWSC’s focus is wildlife.
Each organization exists because issues related to the intersection of offshore wind and fisheries often differ from those of wildlife and endangered species.
The scope of the RWSC Science Plan does not include fisheries or commercially managed fish species.
For research needs and considerations on those topics, visit [ROSA](https://www.rosascience.org/).
To ensure close coordination on issues in the RWSC Science Plan that might relate with ROSA’s work and avoid duplication of efforts, the RWSC Protected Fish Species Subcommittee includes members from ROSA leadership.
The RWSC and ROSA have, and will continue to, work closely together to support research and monitoring of fish and offshore wind.

In addition to the federally administered ESA, each state/district compiles a species of concern list.
Species of concern for each state may also be listed federally under the ESA.
The following table includes state or district websites that feature marine fish species of concern.
The Subcommittee wanted to note these species in the Appendix, though they are not included in the scope of the chapter and will not be fully assessed.

Internationally, the IUCN Red List [@theiucn] is a resource that lists the global conservation status for all species, including fish.
Each species is sorted into one of nine groups: Not Evaluated, Data Deficient, Least Concern, Near Threatened, Vulnerable, Endangered, Critically Endangered, Extinct in the Wild or Extinct.
IUCN Red List species are not covered further in this chapter.

The Subcommittee also discussed species that do not appear on any protected species list, but may be impacted by the development of offshore wind.
One such group are HMS, including all tuna, swordfish, billfishes, and sharks.
There are also prohibited fish in various fisheries, so while not explicitly protected, it can be illegal to target and harvest certain fish.
A few additional species brought forth by the Subcommittee for their potential to be impacted by offshore wind are the Warsaw grouper (E*pinephelus nigritus*) and the speckled hind (E*pinephelus drummondhayi*), as well as all previously petitioned and listed species.
Cusk (*Brosme brosme*) was very recently removed from the candidate listing, so was not listed under the ESA and does not appear in Table 1.
However, this species may be impacted by offshore wind development, particularly in the Gulf of Maine, as its habitat is limited.
These species were not included in the scope of this chapter as they are not currently listed under the ESA.

The subcommittee notes that while this plan focuses on ESA Listed fish, concern remains regarding the impacts of offshore wind development on other fish species that overlap with ongoing and planned offshore wind development activities in the western Atlantic.
This list of Protected Fish Species in the RWSC Study area will be updated periodically as more research is conducted and more information becomes available.

#### Atlantic Sturgeon

Atlantic sturgeon are anadromous, meaning they hatch in freshwater, migrate to salt water as sub adults, and return to freshwater as adults to spawn.
sturgeon distribution and abundance varies by season [@dunton], and they are bottom feeders, mainly consuming benthic invertebrates and fish close to the seabed.
Earlier reported observer catch data showed that Atlantic sturgeon bycatch mostly occurred closest to the coasts, particularly bay mouths and inlets, so likely preferred shallower water with sandy bottom [@steinandrew2004].
Studies conducted in more recent years suggest that their habitat and distribution is likely more expansive, and that additional targeted research is needed to fully and accurately assess Atlantic sturgeon habitat [@ingram2019].
Atlantic sturgeon in the New York Wind Energy Area were regularly detected, with peaks from November through January and nearly absent July through September [@ingram2019].
In addition, detections of unique fish decreased with an increasing distance from shore, though they did spread throughout the entire study array.
Environmental factors were also explored, and photoperiod was determined to be a consistent trigger for migration while river temperature and discharge were two additional local factors [@ingram2019].
The near-shelf region of Maryland was found to be mainly a transit route for Atlantic sturgeon [@rothermel2020; @secor2020].
They primarily occupied warmer bottom temperatures, and had the lowest detection rates in the late spring through early fall.
Atlantic sturgeon were found to occur year round in the Delaware wind energy area, though abundance peaked in November and December [@haulsee2020].
Distribution shifted seasonally within the WEA from shallower areas in the spring and summer to deeper waters in the fall and winter.
Receivers were also deployed in the York River watershed, the Lower James River, the Elizabeth River, the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay, and along the Atlantic coast [@hagerc.2019].
These receivers detected sturgeon that were tagged from Maine to Georgia, illustrating that this species is highly migratory and occurs region wide.
The Atlantic sturgeon’s distribution throughout the region and frequent detections within WEAs illustrates the need for further research and continued monitoring.

It was previously accepted that Atlantic sturgeon spawn only in the spring, though evidence of fall spawning was documented in the more southern river systems, specifically the Combahee and Edisto rivers, SC [@collins2000; @farrae2017], Roanoke River, NC [@smith2015], James River, VA [@balazikmatthew2012; @balazikmt2015], and Marshy Hope Creek, MD [@secor2022].
A dual spawning strategy was also described from research suggesting the spawning of two groups at two different times and locations in the James River, adding to the known species level variation [@balazikmt2015].
A study conducted to inform spatial distribution models of sturgeon concluded that depth, day-of-year, sea surface temperature, and light absorption by seawater were the primary predictors of occurrence in the mid-Atlantic Bight [@breecem.w.2018].
This model can be implemented to reduce harmful interactions with sturgeon.
Even with the increased number of research projects in recent years, the Atlantic sturgeon is still considered a data poor species [@asmfc2017].
As such, Hager [@hagerc.2019] indicated the need to expand the understanding of environmental variables that impact sturgeon distribution in order to effectively manage the species.

There are five DPSs of Atlantic sturgeon listed under the ESA.
The Gulf of Maine DPS was listed as threatened in 2012, and the other four DPSs (Carolina, Chesapeake Bay, New York Bight, and South Atlantic) were all listed as Endangered.
Hare, Jon & Morrison et al., [@hare2016] conducted a climate change vulnerability assessment for species on the Northeast U.S. Continental Shelf, and the Atlantic sturgeon received an Overall Vulnerability Rank of Very High with 99% certainty.
This study focused on fish from the three DPSs in the northeast, and while not studied, sturgeon researchers in the southeast believe that the impacts identified will likely affect the southern DPSs as well (A. Herndon, personal communication).
It is also possible that fish in the Carolina and South Atlantic DPSs have adaptations that make them less vulnerable to increasing temperatures because they already live in warmer climates, but this is uncertain (A. Herndon, personal communication).

The Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission conducts stock assessments on Atlantic sturgeon, the last of which was completed in 2017 [@asmfc2017].
Population numbers declined greatly from high historical levels in part due to overfishing, of which the population has not yet recovered from [@hilton2016].
The 2017 benchmark assessment concluded that the resource of Atlantic Sturgeon is depleted due to multiple contributing factors including incidental capture in fisheries, habitat loss, and ship strike.
That being said, the assessment indicates a positive trend, or a slowly increasing population since 1998 [@asmfc2017].
Entanglement in fishing gear continues to be a problem, even though Atlantic sturgeon are no longer legal to target.
Dunton et al. [@dunton2015] conducted a study on Atlantic sturgeon bycatch in the New York waters, and using regional observer data found that the majority of bycatch occurred in aggregation areas in bottom trawls and sink gillnets.
The large mesh sink gillnet fishery is a major source of bycatch, and as a result of findings and requirements put forth in a Biological Opinion, the Atlantic Sturgeon Bycatch Working Group developed an Action Plan to reduce sturgeon entanglement in the federal fishery by 2024 [@noaafisheries2022a].
Some area closures in existence for other species also benefit Atlantic sturgeon in areas of overlap.
The Gulf of Maine Cod Protection Closures and the Large-Mesh Gillnet Mid Atlantic Seasonal closures are two examples, both of which likely provide protection for sturgeon moving to and from their marine habitat into freshwater.

Vessel strikes, EMFs, degraded water quality, noise, and changes in marine habitat may also negatively affect Atlantic sturgeon.
There is growing concern about sturgeon vessel strikes especially within the Chesapeake and New York Bight DPSs.
A study conducted by Fox et al., [@fox2020] found that the overall reporting rate of Atlantic sturgeon carcasses was 4.76%.
This suggests that vessel strike rates are likely higher than previously thought, as most incidents of vessel strikes are not seen or reported.
These impacts tend to be more severe in estuarine and freshwater habitats.
Rivers all along the East Coast have been defined as critical habitat for Atlantic sturgeon and are shown below in @fig-1.

Atlantic sturgeon habitat use overlaps with many wind farm lease, planning, and cable areas [@frisk2019; @haulsee2020; @ingram2019; @rothermel2020] and so they are subject to all potential effects with respect to offshore wind discussed in section 1.2.

#### Atlantic Salmon

Atlantic salmon in the United States are at the southern extent of their range and are found at critically low abundance.
Historic populations in southern New England are extirpated, with remnant populations protected under the ESA in Maine [@usfws2009].

Atlantic salmon are anadromous fish with life histories that involve a variety of habitats.
They begin their lives in freshwater rivers, migrate through estuaries to saltwater, and return to freshwater to spawn [@fayclem2006].
Restoration, monitoring and research efforts are longstanding within Maine’s coastal rivers, with continued expansion into estuaries and bays [@renkawitz2011; @sheehan2011; @usasac].
Atlantic salmon encounter many threats because they occupy a variety of habitats.
Identifying these threats has been a priority in recent years with particular emphasis focused on the smolt life stage when fish migrate from fresh to salt water and endure a physiological transformation.
Baseline telemetry studies in Maine have outlined migration dynamics [@hawkesj.p.2017; @kocikj.f.2009; @renkawitz2011] and set the stage for follow-up investigations.
These efforts include quantifying impacts of dams [@holbrookc.m.2011; @stevens2019; @stich2015], in addition to targeted management actions [@hawkes2013] to improve smolt survival into the Gulf of Maine.

Beyond monitoring tagged salmon with telemetry in their natal rivers, research has expanded further into the marine environment.
A partnership between NOAA and the University of Maine School of Marine Science began in 2005 by utilizing existing marine infrastructure to increase monitoring capabilities.
This platforms of opportunity initiative began with oceanographic buoys, but has since expanded to lobster traps and drifters.
These data improve our understanding of salmon migration, but also benefit researchers of other tagged animals [@goulettegs2014; @goulette2021].
In addition to these data collections, the deployment of the [Ocean Tracking Network](https://oceantrackingnetwork.org/) Halifax Array off Halifax, Nova Scotia in 2008 expanded coverage of salmon migration.
Information from this array has been used to model behaviors, timing and movements within the Gulf of Maine and beyond, which may be useful to managers [@byron2014; @moriarty2016].

The range of Atlantic salmon is mostly in the northern portion of the Gulf of Maine which currently does not overlap with any lease areas.
However, BOEM has published the Gulf of Maine Call for Information and Nominations (Call) in the deeper waters of the Gulf for floating offshore wind.
This Call is an early step in the regulatory process for commercial leasing of offshore wind.
Atlantic salmon critical habitat has been defined in rivers all along the coast of Maine and is shown below in @fig-2. The range of Atlantic salmon continues east to Canada, so collaboration with international organizations is needed.

Atlantic salmon will likely overlap with all stages of offshore wind development in the Gulf of Maine, so are subject to all potential effects with respect to offshore wind discussed in section 1.2.
