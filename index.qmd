# Welcome {.unnumbered}

This is the website for the first **Integrated Science Plan for Offshore Wind, Wildlife, and Habitat in U.S. Atlantic Waters**.

The RWSC Steering Committee, the four sectors, and hosts---the Northeast Regional Ocean Council and Mid-Atlantic Regional Council on the Ocean with the Coastal States Stewardship Foundation---collaboratively funded and developed the Science Plan to inform future data collection and research and to describe a framework for collaboration to address those needs.

The Science Plan is entirely open source.
Making the Science Plan open source allows you or anyone else to interact with the content by opening [issues](https://github.com/RWSCollab/science-plan/issues), making typo fixes and more, for the benefit of everyone.

The Science Plan's website is built by GitHub Actions, which runs the code every time RWSC makes a change, ensuring that the content is up-to-date and versions are tracked.
