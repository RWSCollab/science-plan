    "section": "Summary of Research Recommendations",
    "text": "Summary of Research Recommendations\nTo develop the Science Plan, the RWSC Steering Committee convened six expert Subcommittees — Marine Mammal, Bird & Bat, Sea Turtle, Habitat & Ecosystem, Protected Fish Species, and Technology. Contributors spanned the federal agencies, states, offshore wind companies, environmental nonprofits, academic and research institutions, and other private entities. RWSC received comments and input from these groups and the public that greatly improved this Plan (see Science Plan Review & Revision Process).\nThis section consolidates the detailed recommendations to the RWSC Steering Committee made by each Subcommittee in the Science Plan to address data gaps and needs. Each Subcommittee’s chapter provides more information about the geographies where certain activities should occur, ecological and logistical considerations for implementing recommendations, and the entities who are leading existing work. The Sector Caucuses expect that for the RWSC to implement these recommendations, many different science entities may take on roles to fund, guide, or otherwise support the work needed to address the recommendations based upon the entity’s expertise, capacity, available resources, and existing data collection, research, and data management portfolio.\n\nThe recommendations are as follows:\n\nLeverage the existing data management infrastructure within the federal government and private sector. Encourage agencies and entities responsible for managing and funding existing repositories coordinate via the RWSC to understand and anticipate the needed capacity and functionality given the volume and variety of offshore wind and wildlife data being collected.\nSeek to apply consistent data collection, QA/QC, data management, data storage, and data sharing guidance for all offshore wind and wildlife studies, as developed or recommended by each Subcommittee.\nWork with offshore wind companies, agencies, contractors/vendors, and researchers to encourage specific collaboratives, data sharing agreements, and tools that facilitate appropriate access to key datasets for use in decision-making and research.\nSeek to fund data collection and research tailored to the mix of species present and the need for baseline data in each subregion, according to each chapter in the Science Plan.\n\nEncourage new data collection activities to align with the objectives of the NOAA Fisheries and BOEM Federal Survey Mitigation Strategy, if applicable.\nContinue to assess the need for and conduct as necessary baseline data collection for relevant species and improve collection for species that are relatively data-poor, including sea turtles, bats, and protected fish species. Monitor species’ movement in, and use of, wind energy areas and adjacent areas consistently in U.S. Atlantic waters.\nBaseline data collection should continue in areas where leasing and construction is planned. The focus for currently leased and progressing areas in Southern New England and New York/New Jersey Bight should be to conduct project-level monitoring studies using consistent methods and approaches to characterize potential impacts from construction and operation.\nEncourage consistent methods and approaches for data collection, data analysis, and data management efforts to support regional scale assessments and the development and maintenance of regional data products and tools.\n\nEncourage using RWSC to coordinate research planning, data collection, data analysis, and data management for the following types of offshore wind-related wildlife surveys and sensor networks throughout the study area funded by multiple entities that benefit from regional collaboration:\n\nLong-term archival passive acoustic monitoring for marine mammal monitoring and soundscape characterization.\nConduct tagging and visual surveys of marine mammals and sea turtles to provide the most complete information and context about marine mammal and sea turtle distribution, habitat use, and behavior.\nAcoustic telemetry receiver network and tagging efforts for sea turtles and protected fish species.\nPerformance evaluation of new technologies for mitigation and long-term monitoring of protected species.\nMotus (radio telemetry) receiver network and tagging efforts for birds and bats.\nRepeated, regular, high-definition aerial photography surveys that cover multiple contiguous and proximate lease areas and characterize multiple taxa.\nSeafloor habitat data collection and compilation, including sensitive hard bottom and coral habitats.\nDeployment of multi-sensor oceanographic and ecological buoys in areas of high biodiversity and/or habitat value.\n\nOptimize the design of surveys and sensor networks to detect broad scale phenomena such as species displacement, changes in abundance, and/or changes in behavior and health using power analyses or other statistical tools.\nContinue to update existing Atlantic coast-wide species distribution models (marine mammals, seabirds, sea turtles) and develop new models with the latest at-sea observations, movement data, and environmental data every 2-3 years. Produce and maintain a standardized set of regional seafloor habitat and oceanographic data products for use as covariates in species distribution modeling and other analyses.\nAs per the National Academies of Sciences recommendations, conduct oceanographic observations and modeling to differentiate changes to hydrodynamics from climate change and offshore wind development at turbine, windfarm, and broader scales.\nExpand on and link existing studies of prey species, including plankton, across the Atlantic to establish a broader ecosystem wide observing system that can detect patterns, trends, and trophic linkages.\nFor studies of potential impacts, consider following existing guidance and best practices for study design and analysis as compiled by the Subcommittees for consistency and leverage the opportunity to combine individual studies into broader regional scale analyses.\nAdvance technologies to improve wildlife detection and impact mitigation and ensure consistent technology performance evaluation."

    "section": "Implementing the Science Plan – a Framework for Collaboration",
    "text": "Implementing the Science Plan – a Framework for Collaboration\nTo ensure that the data collection and research efforts recommended in the Science Plan are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR)3, the four Sectors have recommended a voluntary framework for collaboration through the RWSC. This framework has three primary goals:\n\nPromote coordination of regional offshore wind related wildlife research with the RWSC, regardless of funding source, recipient(s), or funding structure.\nEnsure that data collection and research methods and products (i) meet the needs of decision-makers, (ii) are scientifically sound, (iii) standardized, and (iv) made available for use as soon as feasible or appropriate to inform and improve decision-making.\nCommunicate the findings and results of individual and collaborative research.\n\nRWSC welcomes and encourages participation from all entities and individuals in implementing this Science Plan, especially via expert Subcommittee meetings4. To assist in the implementation of the Science Plan, the RWSC will maintain the Offshore Wind & Wildlife Research Database and continue to provide tools and forums for research planning, discussions, and collaboration among all participants. All are encouraged to participate in implementing the Science Plan by:\n\nMaintaining situational awareness of data collection and research activities to identify opportunities for collaboration, consistency, and efficiency. This can be accomplished in part by participating regularly in RWSC Sector Caucus and expert Subcommittee meetings and by encouraging relevant grantees, contractors, and researchers to share project information with the RWSC. Several RWSC participants have noted the value of Subcommittee meetings as forums for sharing research plans, discussing emerging issues, and working together across sectors to advance Science Plan objectives. The Subcommittees will continue to meet regularly to share information on the latest study results, ongoing and planned research and data collection, and to periodically review data management infrastructure needs and workflows. Entities will be able to coordinate as needed with the relevant RWSC Subcommittee(s) prior to new data collection (to ensure consistency and reduce duplication) and analysis (to facilitate access to the available data) and share details about where and when activities take place to avoid conflicts. The RWSC will facilitate this objective via the Offshore Wind & Wildlife Research Database, web mapping tools, and a data catalog (in development).\nCollaboratively implementing and encouraging the use of best practices for data collection, QA/QC, data management, and storage as specified in this Science Plan. Each Subcommittee has recommended practices for each relevant data type or data collection method in the Science Plan. To encourage uptake and consistent use of these practices, the RWSC will provide suggested language, agreed to by the Sector Caucuses, around data management for participants to use in their own requests for proposals and agreements.\nParticipating in annual discussions of research priorities. The RWSC provides a forum to identify data and research needs based on current data gaps, new research results, emerging decision-making needs, and available funding. To facilitate an adaptive approach to prioritizing the recommendations in the Science Plan, RWSC will convene the sectors each year to review and discuss research priorities. Discussions will be informed by the expert Subcommittees’ work, collaborative workshops, and agreed upon prioritization criteria.\nAligning funds and developing collaborative funding plans. Through annual research prioritization discussions, the RWSC will provide opportunities for participants to voluntarily align their existing research funds to address Science Plan objectives when it makes sense to do so. The RWSC also provides a mechanism for pooling funds to accomplish shared priorities when practical, administering funds, and managing research projects that accomplish Science Plan goals.\n\nRWSC also envisions and welcomes uses of this Science Plan for purposes other than their direct coordination on offshore wind and wildlife data collection and research in U.S. Atlantic waters:\n\nThe Science Plan and its development process can be used as an example for regional offshore wind science entities in other geographies.\nThe greater scientific community can use this plan to shape their own research objectives and inform their funding decisions related to offshore wind and wildlife efforts.\nThe RWSC Science Plan can be used to support multi-sector collaborations to advance career workforce development programs for ecological and biological monitoring roles. The Science Plan serves as a guide to identify the scientific disciplines, the types of roles and the skills (including the educational requirements) necessary to address the research questions5.\n\nRWSC will reassess the Science Plan and framework for collaboration every five years to ensure its continued utility and relevance in light of new information and changes in the rapidly evolving offshore wind industry. The RWSC will track progress on Science Plan recommendations annually."

    "section": "Summary",
    "text": "Summary\nData governance and data management are essential to achieving the RWSC’s goals and the research described in this Science Plan. Data governance encompasses the purpose and processes for collecting and using data, policies such as contract terms and data licenses, and frameworks for technical implementation. Data management executes and informs data governance, supporting the shared goals and agreements with standards, best practices, documentation, and infrastructure. The two practices are complementary and need to operate in tandem, in ways that are responsive to program demands and the capacity of the RWSC community.\nDuring the 2023 Science Plan review, the RWSC held multiple discussions on data governance and management, including a half-day workshop on September 8, 2023. As a result of these discussions, as well as comments received on the draft Science Plan, parts of the original Data Management Chapter have been distributed into relevant Subcommittee chapters while other parts are now incorporated here. This reflects a general desire to divide roles and responsibilities between the RWSC Steering Committee (via a newly created Data Governance Subcommittee) and the expert Subcommittees such that:\n\nThe Data Governance Subcommittee (DGSC) oversees issues that cross disciplines and taxa, like common data sharing terms for contracts, tools for sharing sensitive data, requirements for RWSC-funded projects, or setting a “floor” for data to be included in an RWSC catalog.\nOther Subcommittees and data leads for individual projects hold the primary responsibility for data management of project data and data workflows. This includes applying the recommendations in the Subcommittee chapters for metadata standards, preferred repositories, and data stewardship through the data lifecycle.\n\nThis chapter focuses on the role of data governance and management across projects and Subcommittees—at the RWSC DGSC level—and describes how both the DGSC and other Subcommittees might each advance these efforts. More detailed information on data management for specific data types can be found in each of the Subcommittee chapters, including recommendations for study design, data collection sheet standardization, and other taxa- or method-specific data standards.\nThe RWSC Steering Committee will set up a Data Governance Subcommittee (DGSC) by Spring 2024. The initial scope of work for that group will include:\n\nMapping the offshore wind & wildlife data ecosystem\nDeveloping common policies, minimum data standards, and guidance for data management\nCreating a data catalog\nBuilding network capacity to steward unique or orphaned data\nProviding general data governance support and education\n\nOnce established, the DGSC should refine these goals and develop a workplan for the first year, focusing on tasks that are essential, have high levels of demand, or where DGSC efforts can have high impact. Data governance and management are applicable to every RWSC participant. The remainder of this chapter provides guidance and resources for both the DGSC and anyone looking to implement data governance and management."

    "section": "2.1 Introduction to Data Governance & Management",
    "text": "2.1 Introduction to Data Governance & Management\nFor more background and context, read the Data Governance & Data Management Appendix.\nThe RWSC’s mission is:\n\n“To collaboratively and effectively conduct and coordinate relevant, credible, and efficient regional monitoring and research of wildlife and marine ecosystems that supports the advancement of environmentally responsible and cost-efficient offshore wind power development activities in U.S. Atlantic waters.”\n\nAchieving this mission requires attention to the way monitoring is carried out, by whom, and how results are validated and shared. Delivering efficiencies and coordinating data from collection to research products, across diverse and widespread efforts, will require data governance and management. Well-planned data governance will also help position the RWSC as a trusted resource for research guidance and information.\nData governance focuses on how decisions are made about data and how people and processes are expected to behave in relation to data, including configuring technical infrastructure (Sebastian-Coleman, 2018). Data governance can be created through international agreements, national laws, or implemented at an organizational or project level (Brous et al., 2016; MacFeely et al., 2022). Well-designed data governance supports effective, privacy-protecting data sharing and increases the value and impact of data through access and reuse (Abraham et al., 2019). This is particularly important for environmental data efforts (Fritzenkötter et al., 2022), like the RWSC, where analyses could involve data from a wide range of sources, such as compliance data shared with government agencies, data collected by wind energy companies and their contractors, independent and academic researchers, nonprofit organizations, and other future collaborators. Each of these contributors needs to be confident in how their data will be used and have the capacity to make informed decisions about data sharing, understanding both the potential benefits and risks.\nData governance and management are important to consider at every step of the data lifecycle1. The Science Plan lays out research goals which rely on collaboration across a network of partners and projects. Each of these partnerships and projects may be at a different stage of their data lifecycle. Science Plan participants shared examples of data flows where there was a lack of clarity about how data would be structured or transmitted, inconsistent documentation of data practices, and questions about whether partners had the right agreements in place to allow data sharing. These are the types of questions data governance and management can answer, and the ideal time to discuss these topics is before data collection starts. This is why it is critical for the DGSC and other Subcommittees to coordinate on data governance and management, connecting the project-level guidance in the Subcommittee chapters to the broader data integration work of the DGSC.\nU.S. federal agencies, Atlantic coast states, and offshore wind companies are all funding individual data collection and research activities. Some of these activities are conducted collaboratively but the majority are funded, scoped, and managed under the purview of a single funder or entity. In its role as a coordinator, the RWSC can provide guidance and support for consistency across data efforts and partners, including sharing standards and best practices such as New York’s Wildlife Data Standardization and Sharing report (NYSERDA, 2021).\nCollaboration takes time and resources, and it is essential to the success of the Science Plan. By planning for data governance and management at the RWSC level, not just at the individual research project level, the RWSC can identify where best to invest time and resources to achieve the collective goals of the offshore wind and wildlife community. The RWSC can continue its approach of operating transparently by documenting how tools were chosen, how often templates or protocols will be revised, and other decisions about data. Being open about how these decisions are made builds trust in the data systems used by the RWSC and the data products produced (Lin et al., 2020). Finally, program-level data governance and management can create efficiencies and incentives, like improving data discoverability and access, reducing duplicative research, or increasing the visibility of RWSC science so funders and researchers get citable “credit” for their work generating data and data products."

    "section": "2.2 Implementing Data Governance & Management",
    "text": "2.2 Implementing Data Governance & Management\nThe DGSC will be the primary home for data governance in the RWSC. The recommendations below form an initial scope for the work of the DGSC. Once established, the DGSC should refine its scope and workplan with an eye on:\n\nWhat is absolutely essential (e.g., guidance for RWSC-supported projects, minimum data standards to make a data catalog operational).\nWhat has high levels of demand (e.g., templates for contract and policy language).\nWhere RWSC has unique value (e.g., enabling sharing of sensitive data).\nWhat has high impact (e.g., removes a critical data bottleneck).\n\n\n1 - Mapping the offshore wind & wildlife data ecosystem\nThe offshore wind and wildlife data ecosystem encompasses all the data necessary to answer the questions in the RWSC Science Plan; the agencies, organizations, and individuals that created the data; the data hosts or locations; and the networks that connect them. A data ecosystem’s interconnections are core to its value. If data discovery is difficult or data cannot move from one node to another, the data ecosystem will not be as effective or efficient. Figure 1 provides a high-level concept of the data ecosystem and how elements could be connected to deliver Science Plan products, with a focus on data sources, ownership, and control.\n\n\n\nIdealized conceptual diagram of major components of the offshore wind and wildlife data ecosystem, organized by data contributors. A full map would detail data streams and the entities responsible for connecting those data streams to the Science Plan.\n\n\nDGSC roles:\n\nLead development of the data ecosystem map.\nReview data flows described in Subcommittee chapters and request additional information from Subcommittee leads and partners as needed.\nIdentify common bottlenecks or barriers across data types and sources that could be addressed by consistent guidance, policy, workflows, or other tools from the RWSC.\nEncourage repositories in the data ecosystem to adopt a consistent Atlantic offshore wind “identifier” for data collected in and around Atlantic Wind Energy Areas.\nConsider how the existing RWSC database of relevant research activities and the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic Ocean Data Portals fit into the data ecosystem now, and how those entities might play different roles once the data catalog is created.\n\nSubcommittee roles:\n\nIdentify issues around data flows, interoperability across platforms, and general data access for the DGSC to consider.\nUpdate and maintain documentation on data standards and preferred repositories and provide summaries to DGSC.\nSupport data partners in documenting data flows and identifying barriers and challenges.\n\n\n\n2 - Developing common policies, minimum data standards, and guidance for data management\n\nCommon policies\nRWSC participants expressed strong support for a common library of contract language and guidance on data licensing. While individual repositories may have their own licensing terms, including adding machine-readable license terms to datasets, the DGSC can look across these licensing terms in their repository review and highlight commonalities. Similarly, RWSC staff have already begun compiling data sharing and licensing terms from RWSC partners and from Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) like the MOU between RWSC and the Center for Ocean Leadership to administer research funding. The language library can help partners select the most appropriate terms for their data needs. The DGSC can also explore creating a basic data sharing policy that can be incorporated by reference in any contract.\n\n\nData standards and data management\n“Ensuring appropriate data and standards are in place to support science priorities” is part of the RWSC’s core purpose. At the September 2023 RWSC Data Governance workshop, participants were interested in common standards for: metadata across agencies, sectors, and groups; attribution; data management; data collection methods; long-term storage; and data quality. This is an area where there is a high degree of interest and expertise in the RWSC community, as well as strong opinions about the merits of different tools and approaches. Standardizing data and data processes has many benefits:\n\nReduced cost for funders of research: funders can reference standard practices rather than spending time detailing them in a scope of work or updating study requirements as science and research technologies advance.\nReduced cost/time for data collectors: researchers can use and cite standard practices rather than developing new protocols and avoid collecting unnecessary or incompatible data.\nEnsures a standard product: funders can be sure that they paid for “good” data that met a set of community-developed criteria; data can be used in future analyses.\nMore efficient science and management decision-making: access and analyses are faster which streamlines interpretation and use.\n\nThe RWSC will have the opportunity to set specific requirements for projects funded through the RWSC Offshore Wind & Wildlife Research Fund. Requirements should include explicit budgeting for data management (at least 10% of total project costs (Tanhua et al., 2019; Trice et al., 2021)), designation of a data manager who will be responsible for development of a data management and sharing plan, and seeing that data are appropriately documented and shared. The DGSC should lead the development of these requirements, including creating a data management and sharing plan template, starting with a review of existing programs to identify guidance and best practices.\nConsistent, complete metadata is the foundation of the offshore wind & wildlife data ecosystem and the ability to create an RWSC data catalog. Standardized metadata is part of the global best practice of making data FAIR — Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable — within the RWSC community and beyond (Tanhua et al., 2019; Wilkinson et al., 2016). FAIR principles are consistent with the RWSC’s core values of Transparency and Accessibility and not only support the Science Plan, but also support future re-use by new partners for questions not yet imagined (Hoeberling, 2022). In addition to the FAIR principles, the CARE principles for Indigenous data stewardship provide guidance for working with Indigenous knowledge and other information from communities while respecting data sovereignty and local control (Carroll et al., 2020). The RWSC should strive to achieve FAIR principles for all data and incorporate CARE principles as appropriate.\nMetadata standards and data standards are often prescribed by repositories. However, the DGSC will need to look across the recommended repositories to formulate a ‘minimum information standard’ that will ensure inclusion of useful information in the RWSC data catalog. This should not be a wholly new standard but a clear subset of components drawn from existing metadata standards recommended by the Subcommittees. For the data catalog, the RWSC may develop guidance and tools that explain and streamline metadata creation for new or undocumented data or utilize software that programmatically gleans existing metadata from data that are already published or archived in repositories.\nDGSC roles:\n\nReview the metadata and data standards for the repositories recommended by the Subcommittees.\nDevelop the minimum metadata set for the data catalog and facilitate review by Subcommittees.\nDevelop a data management and sharing plan template for RWSC-funded projects.\nCreate a basic data sharing policy that can be incorporated by reference in any contract.\n\nSubcommittee roles:\n\nEncourage and support RWSC participants to use the data repositories recommended by the Subcommittees.\nDevelop or encourage and support RWSC participants to use standard data collection templates/data sheets for each taxon or data type.\nInform the development of the DGSC data sharing and management template and adapt it to meet Subcommittee needs, data types, and data products.\n\n\n\n\n3 - Creating a Data Catalog\nData catalogs are detailed collections of metadata that make up a searchable inventory of datasets and products. The RWSC data catalog would connect the components of the offshore wind and wildlife data ecosystem and enable the discovery and sharing of data funded by the RWSC and partners in support of the Science Plan. With a robust data catalog, RWSC would function as a coordinator and information hub without having to store data or serve as a data repository. The Offshore Wind & Wildlife Research Database contains information at the project level, but a data catalog would operate at the dataset or data product level. It would pull descriptive metadata describing each dataset from the external repositories in the offshore wind and wildlife data ecosystem so that anyone could find and access it.\nThe minimum metadata set in Recommendation #2 will be needed for the catalog to operate, and the wind “identifier” described in Recommendation #1 could also assist in pulling in data from external repositories.\nDGSC roles:\n\nDevelop technical requirements for the catalog.\nReview and evaluate potential catalog hosts and technical infrastructure.\nRecommend options to the Steering Committee.\n\nSubcommittee roles:\n\nRecommend catalog hosting options.\n\n\n\n4 - Building network capacity to steward unique or orphaned data\nWhile this may not be a major focus for the DGSC, there are data types, such as large image files from aerial high-definition cameras or thermal cameras, that do not have an existing repository. For the RWSC and partners to be able to preserve this data for future use, the DGSC will need to investigate options for hosting the data. This could involve working with partners who manage or maintain existing data infrastructure to develop a solution. Having the RWSC procure and maintain its own hosting solution should be a last resort, due to the limited capacity of the organization.\nDGSC roles:\n\nAs requested, explore solutions for orphan data.\n\nSubcommittee roles:\n\nIdentify orphan datasets that need alternate hosting solutions.\nRecommend data standards and best practices for data documentation.\n\n\n\n5 - Providing general data governance support and education\nRWSC data partners and participants have a wide range of expertise and disciplinary backgrounds. This makes it important to develop shared language around data governance, data management, and participant expectations. The DGSC should explore creating a data handbook and glossary of key terms that helps anyone engage with the data ecosystem, whether they are agency managers, data scientists, biologists, or attorneys. The DGSC could also write up case studies and examples showing how data governance works from different partner perspectives and for different data types and workflows, helping make the concept of data governance more tangible. This type of community education will help develop consistency and shared understanding across the RWSC’s efforts and build the overall data capacity of the offshore wind and wildlife community.\n\n\n\n\nAbraham, R., Schneider, J., Brocke, J. vom, 2019.

    "section": "3.2 Data Collection",
    "text": "3.2 Data Collection\nSeveral entities are requiring, funding, and/or advocating for marine mammal research and data collection activities with respect to offshore wind. Ongoing and planned activities, including marine mammal monitoring that is being required by agencies, are captured in the Offshore Wind & Wildlife Research Database.\nIndividuals and entities should consult with the Marine Mammal Subcommittee prior to collecting marine mammal data with respect to offshore wind to ensure that any new data collection does not duplicate existing efforts and is consistent with the tools and approaches already in use. Any individual or entity may join public Marine Mammal Subcommittee meetings by obtaining meeting links on the RWSC website.\nA combination of methods (visual, acoustic, tagging) is recommended to provide the most complete information and context to marine mammal observations, given the strengths and limitations of each method alone (see the Marine Mammal Appendix for more information):\n\n(Cross taxa) Leveraging BOEM’s and NOAA’s ongoing efforts, ensure that the required Protected Species Observer data collected by offshore wind companies during construction and operations via Pile Driving Monitoring Plans and Vessel Strike Avoidance Plans (and any other mitigation plans) follows a consistent reporting approach and is eventually submitted to a Master Protected Species Observer Sightings Database for use in marine mammal analyses and research.\nEnsure that other marine mammal and environmental data collection required by the agencies during installation (e.g., sound fields, visual monitoring, PAM, thermal/infrared camera systems) are collected using consistent methods such that data can be used in other analyses and research including broader scale analyses of potential impacts across many projects.\n(Cross-taxa) Continue to support regional scale protected species and habitat data collection activities through the Atlantic Marine Assessment Program for Protected Species (AMAPPS), Ecosystem Monitoring Survey; NOAA Fisheries North Atlantic Right Whale Aerial Surveys, NOAA Fisheries Marine Mammal and Sea Turtle Aerial Surveys, NOAA Fisheries Marine Mammal, Sea Turtle, and Seabird ship-based surveys; NOAA Fisheries Seal aerial abundance surveys. Advance the NOAA Fisheries and BOEM Survey Mitigation Strategy (Hare et al., 2022) to ensure that site-specific and regional scale studies are put in the context of population trends and ecosystem conditions.\n(Cross-taxa) Coordinate regular high-definition aerial surveys that cover multiple lease areas using the same tools and methods. This effort should leverage the considerable amount of high-definition aerial photography data collected during site assessment by multiple offshore wind developers, and the Southern New England megafauna aerial surveys that have occurred consistently since 2011.\nContinue to support the adaptive design and implementation of a regional long-term archival passive acoustic monitoring network in the Atlantic Ocean and guide future research including:\n\nCharacterize baseline ambient sound and sound/noise during all phases of development, leveraging the regional passive acoustic monitoring network.\nExpand passive acoustic monitoring outside of wind energy areas, especially along the shelf break, including using gliders and real-time systems.\nTo the extent practicable, ensure alignment between archival and real-time deployments. Ensure that whale detections from real-time systems can be folded into analyses and data products that also leverage archival detections.\nIncorporate collection of oceanographic data and prey fields into the regional-scale PAM network.\nImprove estimates of acoustic detection rates and cue rates of baleen whales during non-construction conditions.\nImprove dose-response curves by obtaining in-situ behavioral data at offshore wind construction sites on baleen whale responses to pile driving noise. This would require collecting a range of data types including PAM and visual observations (aerial or ship-based).\nCouple aerial/visual monitoring with acoustic monitoring to address the issues above and better link the resulting observational datasets.\nCo-deploy acoustic telemetry receivers to build out a telemetry receiver network, and other sensors as practicable.\n\nCollect marine mammal behavioral and health data through tagging and visual observations to determine how individuals interact with wind farm structures and whether changes to foraging, socializing, or reproduction are occurring.\nIn collaboration with NOAA Fisheries, continue and expand stranding data collection and analysis with respect to strandings and mortality data time series analysis for the U.S. Atlantic Ocean.\nMonitor entanglement with subsea structure of floating offshore wind structures. Monitor secondary entanglement where derelict fishing gear/marine debris may attach to subsurface offshore wind structures.\nAdvance oceanographic and biological data collection and use in marine mammal research.\n\nCoordinate with the North East Regional Association of Coastal and Ocean Observing Systems (NERACOOS), Mid-Atlantic Regional Association of Coastal Ocean Observing Systems (MARACOOS), and Southeastern Coastal Ocean Observing Regional Association (SECOORA).\nLeverage existing ocean observing platforms or add new ocean observing assets for marine mammal monitoring.\nWork with the Habitat & Ecosystem Subcommittee to ensure that key oceanographic and habitat data are collected and available as data products for use in marine mammal studies and as model covariates.\nWork with the Habitat & Ecosystem Subcommittee to determine whether offshore wind structures alter hydrodynamics, stratification, and mixing, and/or prey distribution and abundance.\nContinue to collect data across the region that allows analysis and synthesis of prey fields. Develop a coordinated regional scale zooplankton monitoring and mapping effort that builds off of and links existing surveys and studies including programs monitoring dimethyl sulfide, Ecosystem Monitoring Survey, Continuous Plankton Recorder, the Gulf of Maine MBON, BOEM-funded Zooplankton Ecology study, Canadian AZMP, Center for Coastal Studies, Northeast U.S. Shelf LTER, and projects conducted by Stony Brook University and Rutgers University to establish a broader ecosystem observing system, synthesize patterns, and identify trends and linkages across trophic levels.\n\n\nThere is a need to advance technologies that improve marine mammal detection during all phases of offshore wind development, and to ensure that the performance of new technologies is evaluated consistently (see the Technology Chapter):\n\nDevelop, evaluate performance, and apply existing and emerging technologies that enhance marine mammal detection, including thermal cameras, infrared cameras, passive acoustics systems, and systems that integrate multiple methods for use during construction and operational monitoring and mitigation. Test “smart” mitigation methods triggered by marine mammal presence as determined by these systems.\nAdvance quieting technologies meant to mitigate construction noise (piledriving, vessel traffic) and operational noise (vessel traffic, operational vibratory sound).\nDevelop and deploy safe long-duration satellite tagging telemetry technology for tracking high-resolution movements of marine mammals in and around offshore wind structures.\nImprove analysis of monitoring data through artificial intelligence, automated acoustic, and image processing, and near real-time data availability.\n(Cross taxa) Develop and test eDNA assays/surveys/sampling regimes to understand efficacy of use developing indices of occurrence/abundance, including testing the effect of carcasses in the environment on eDNA detection.\n\nThe Gulf of Maine has long represented important feeding grounds for baleen whales from late fall to early spring (NOAA CetSound, 2015). A resident population of Harbor porpoise is present in the coastal/nearshore areas of the Gulf of Maine from July to September (NOAA CetSound, 2015). Almost all of the Gulf of Maine subregion is critical habitat (Northeastern U.S. foraging area) for North Atlantic right whales. Given that offshore wind development areas are still being identified in this subregion, baseline data collection should seek to characterize fine scale spatial and temporal habitat use. Studies of impacts specific to floating offshore wind (e.g., secondary entanglement), including modeling, should be coordinated through the Subcommittee. Cape Cod Bay, as a historical whale aggregation location, could serve as a sentinel site or control site to monitor potential population-level impacts to whales.\nIn Southern New England, known whale foraging hotspots (e.g., Nantucket Shoals) should be monitored using multiple methods to understand potential changes in behavior and habitat use. Studies of hydrodynamics and physical oceanography at the turbine-, wind farm-, and regional-scales should seek to separate climate change drivers from offshore wind development and understand any changes that may impact whale prey (ACP, 2023; NASEM, 2023).\nWhale and dolphin sightings in the New York/New Jersey Bight have increased recently and includes increases in juvenile humpback whales in coastal waters, likely due to an increase in their menhaden prey. These whales may be particularly vulnerable to vessel strike due to their behavior and high density and speed of vessels in nearshore waters of this region (Stepanuk et al., 2021). Studies of whale-prey relationships and potential displacement from offshore wind areas in this region should be tailored to this context and capture rapidly changing ecosystem conditions and existing human uses in this area.\nThe U.S. Central Atlantic includes small resident populations of bottlenose dolphins, and large whales occur here and in the U.S. Southeast Atlantic at relatively lower densities than the other subregions. Data collection strategies and studies should be designed with the lower expected densities in mind. Both regions are important migratory routes, and the U.S. Southeast Atlantic contains critical habitat for North Atlantic right whale calving. More information is needed about the ways that reproductively active female right whales respond (or do not respond) to physical structures, noise, and vessels in their environment before wind projects are implemented in the Southeast right whale calving habitat. Characterizations of marine mammal distribution, abundance, and movement should continue in these subregions using multiple methods as offshore wind planning and development advances."

The Subcommittee is especially interested in studies that seek to distinguish between climate change-driven shifts in marine mammal distribution, abundance, and behavior and changes that may be driven by offshore wind construction and operation. Related changes of interest include:\n\nWhether construction activities displace or attract marine mammals\nWhether offshore wind structures displace or attract marine mammals\nWhether marine mammal feeding is altered due to changes to hydrodynamics or prey distribution/abundances caused by offshore wind structures\n\nIndividuals and entities should consult with the Marine Mammal Subcommittee prior to conducting analyses of marine mammal data with respect to offshore wind to ensure that the study leverages all of the available data and contributes to addressing the key recommendations described below to the extent possible:\n\nLeverage extensive existing and long-term data sources. These include but are not limited to AMAPPS, NOAA Fisheries North Atlantic Right Whale Aerial Surveys, Southern New England Aerial Megafauna Surveys, long-term/archival PAM, as well as shorter-duration observational studies (aerial, boat-based, tagging) as foundational elements of any analysis.\nConduct a synthetic baseline assessment of marine mammals over the past several decades to characterize pre-development levels of spatial and temporal variability in marine mammal distribution and abundance patterns, from which to measure and assess any potential changes after the onset of offshore wind construction and regional-scale operation activities. Integrate density modeling and/or visual survey data, passive acoustic monitoring data, tagging data, oceanography/habitat data, and climate data to characterize pre-development levels of spatial and temporal variability in marine mammal distribution and abundance patterns.\nContinue to update and improve marine mammal density models. Use outputs to understand drivers of marine mammal distribution and movement and to assess/detect change, displacement, and/or potential impacts. Periodically evaluate model performance and use validation and evaluation results to continually inform and advance model/framework development and applications.\n\nIntegrate the latest observational and environmental data every 2-3 years.\nIntegrate data from multiple additional methods (strandings, digital aerial surveys, passive acoustic data, tagging) and covariates (oceanographic and prey distribution). Apply results to inform research designs, determine baseline abundance/distribution estimates, best practices, etc.\nConsider how to structure future model “eras” to reflect offshore wind pre-construction and construction/operation.\nThe modeling framework should be scalable to individual projects and the whole region such that individual project-specific outputs could be pooled into regional-scale versions of the model.\n\nRepeat a power analysis to optimize the design of the long-term archival passive acoustic monitoring network every 3-5 years. Ensure that new monitoring assets and analysis results are accounted for and that existing or new hypotheses and questions can be addressed by the regional network.\nInform and evaluate the effectiveness of mitigation strategies meant to minimize impacts resulting from increases in vessel traffic (i.e., noise, collision, displacement) from construction and maintenance of offshore wind projects.\n\nDevelop or update existing vessel and marine mammal co-occurrence models with information from the offshore wind industry regarding vessel types and numbers. Validate models with AIS and effort-corrected whale sightings data.\nConduct studies to assess the effectiveness of mitigation strategies such as speed restrictions, establishment of traffic corridors, etc.\n\nModel and assess entanglement risks associated with floating offshore wind.\nBuild off Project WOW and apply lessons learned to studies in and around other lease areas outside Southern New England and New York/New Jersey Bight. Use Project WOW Frameworks to identify stressors, species, and geographic areas to conduct assessments of displacement, attraction, or other changes to wildlife abundance, distribution, behavior, and/or health.\nIntegrate multiple types of data (e.g., acoustic, visual, stable isotopes, bycatch estimates, vessel trip reports) to understand potential changes in marine mammal feeding behaviors.\nDetermine whether prey distribution, abundance and/or behavior is altered due to hydrodynamic changes caused by offshore wind structures and from EMF/cables (heat and electromagnetic field).\nScope studies of EMF and marine mammals.

The Bird & Bat Subcommittee aims to work with individuals and entities who collect data relevant to avian offshore wind research to ensure that data are collected and stored in consistent formats that allow for comparisons among and pooling across individual projects in the RWSC study area.  This standardization is intended to support regional-scale assessments and the development and maintenance of regional data products and tools.\nIn support of these efforts, the Bird & Bat Subcommittee recommends:\n\nMaintenance of an up-to-date resource list of recommended standard databases, data repositories, guidelines, and protocols for use by all data collectors.

As part of Construction and Operations Plans (COPs), offshore wind developers are developing and submitting avian monitoring plans. Current available draft monitoring plans typically include deploying Motus and/or satellite tags on birds of conservation concern for a specified number of years post-construction, deploying and maintaining Motus receiver stations for a specified number of years, deploying passive acoustic or multi-sensor detectors on turbines or other offshore wind facility infrastructure, and conducting boat-based or aerial surveys. State agencies, federal agencies, and conservation and research organizations regularly deploy tags, deploy and maintain Motus stations, and conduct surveys of nesting birds within the RWSC Study Region. Standardized boat-based and aerial surveys are also conducted with state and federal funding.\nAs part of addressing near and long-term goals, and in the context of ongoing work, the Bird & Bat Subcommittee recommends the following field research, data interpretation, and technology advancement activities:\n\nUsing appropriate methods to further characterize movements, distributions, and abundance of wide-ranging bird species offshore, before and after construction.\n\nThe Bird & Bat Subcommittee will convene regularly to coordinate tagging/tracking efforts for species of interest in the context of offshore wind along the U.S. Atlantic Coast. Activities will include identifying general focal locations and focal species for tag deployment, exploring the potential to centralize tag deployment efforts, and coordinating deployment, calibration, and maintenance of Motus receiver network infrastructure.\nCoordinating and conducting regular digital aerial surveys that cover multiple lease areas and appropriate buffer zones using a standardized methodology. As wind energy areas are leased and developed, aerial surveys covering individual lease areas plus appropriate buffers (see draft guidance) can be expected to survey portions of adjacent lease areas, so coordination could provide cost-efficiencies, as well as supporting standardized data products.\nDeploying passive acoustics and multi-modal systems at offshore wind facilities and on other offshore infrastructure to monitor for nocturnal migrants.\n\nContinuing standardized breeding bird surveys along coastlines and on islands to understand population dynamics, assess species distributions, and inform population models (see Data Analysis).\nExpanding seabird diet and foraging studies to inform understanding of offshore wind facility effects. Conducting laboratory analyses of previously stored samples, as needed.\nDeploying multi-modal systems on turbines to assess bird interactions with wind turbine infrastructure (including micro-avoidance and collision risk). Combinations of acoustic detectors, radar systems, impact detection sensors, and/or visual, thermal, and infrared cameras are recommended to document bird behavior around wind turbines, detect impacts, and, to the extent possible, provide species-specific identification.\nIn addition to the methods detailed above, deployment of radar or lidar systems to document bird passage rates and flight heights is also recommended.\nDeveloping, testing, and advancing new, emerging, or under-utilized technologies for monitoring and mitigation.\n\nTesting and validating bird collision detection systems (recognizing that initial validation may need to focus on land-based wind facilities, where carcass counts are possible).\nTesting and validating the efficacy of on-site mitigation strategies (e.g., lighting, painted blades), including evaluation in both land-based and offshore environments.\nTesting and validating the efficacy of off-site mitigation strategies or voluntary conservation offsets. (This is expected to take place only after the planning for and identification of appropriate options as described under Data Analysis.)\nImproving remote access to wildlife monitoring equipment on wind turbine platforms or other offshore infrastructure. This could include identifying workflows to allow for the transmission of wildlife monitoring data using existing wind facility fiber-optic networks.\nScoping and designing standardized spaces on offshore wind infrastructure to support wildlife monitoring equipment, including physical access, electrical power, data transfer capabilities, etc. This will require cross-sector and cross-taxa coordination.\nDesigning and improving automated methods to efficiently derive data from raw data files, such as deriving species identification and counts from digital aerial photographs, species identification within acoustic recordings, or tracking movement paths on radar and video recordings.\nDeveloping and improving tagging technologies to allow for lighter tags, longer-term tracking, measurement of additional parameters, or more precise measurement (e.g., of flight height)."

As part of Construction and Operations Plans (COPs), offshore wind developers are developing and submitting avian and bat monitoring plans. Of relevance to bats, current available draft monitoring plans typically include deploying passive acoustic detectors on turbines or other offshore wind facility infrastructure, deploying active acoustic detectors on work vessels accessing the facility, and deploying and maintaining Motus receiver stations for a specified number of years post-construction. State agencies, federal agencies, and research organizations regularly deploy acoustic detectors in coastal environments. Motus or standard VHF tags have also been deployed on bats utilizing habitat in coastal areas (Dowling, 2018; Peterson et al., 2021; True et al., 2023).\nAs part of addressing near and long-term goals, the Bird & Bat Subcommittee recommends the following field research, data interpretation, and technology advancement activities:\n\nData collection to characterize bat activity and collision risk in the rotor-swept zone of offshore wind turbines.\n\nUsing passive acoustic detectors mounted on turbine platforms, towers, and nacelles to document bat activity year-round.\nDeploying multi-modal systems on turbines to assess bat interactions with wind turbine infrastructure (including micro-avoidance and collision risk). Combinations of acoustic detectors, radar systems, impact detection sensors, and/or visual, thermal, and infrared cameras are recommended to document bat behavior around wind turbines, detect impacts, and, in some cases, provide species-specific identification.\nRecording contemporaneous turbine operational status and local meteorological data to inform patterns of bat activity, behavior, and collision risk relative to turbine operation and environmental conditions.\n\nUse of acoustics to better understand onshore-to-offshore gradients of bat activity pre- and post-construction. Leveraging existing platforms (e.g., vessels which already make regular trips through offshore waters, offshore buoys, other offshore infrastructure) and coastal and island sites will aid in this effort.\nUse of Motus tagging/tracking systems to characterize patterns of bat movement offshore (Acoustic studies alone may fail to fully capture bat activity if bats regularly refrain from  echolocation while flying over the ocean (Corcoran et al., 2021; Corcoran and Weller, 2018).\n\nDeploying Motus tags on migratory tree bats (hoary bats, eastern red bats, silver-haired bats) to evaluate patterns of movement during the spring and late summer-fall migration seasons.\nDeploying Motus tags on Perimyotis and Myotis species of conservation concern in coastal areas and on islands in late summer to evaluate dispersal from maternity colonies to swarming or overwintering sites.\nCoordinating deployment of Motus stations to streamline calibration and optimize placement (see Chapter 4).\n\nDevelopment, testing, and advancement of new, emerging, or under-utilized technologies for monitoring and mitigation.\n\nTesting and validating bat collision detection systems (recognizing that initial validation may need to focus on land-based wind facilities, where carcass counts are possible).\nImproving access to remote wildlife monitoring data and integrating wildlife monitoring equipment on wind turbine platforms or other offshore infrastructure. This could include identifying workflows to allow for the transmission of wildlife monitoring data using existing wind facility fiber-optic networks.\nDesigning and improving auto-classification of acoustic data to identify species or taxa.\nImproving tagging technologies and attachment methods to allow for lighter tags and longer-term tracking.\nIf mitigation is deemed necessary, testing and validating the efficacy of on-site mitigation strategies (e.g., feathering, curtailment, deterrents). As noted above, validation of mitigation in the offshore environment will be difficult, and the development of effective bat collision detection systems, validated at land-based wind facilities, would be necessary for validation of mitigation measures in the offshore environment. Alternatively, efficacy would need to be estimated based on land-based proxies and the best available science."

The Subcommittee is comprised of sea turtle experts from federal agencies, states, research institutions, and other private entities. Any individual or entity may join public Sea Turtle Subcommittee meetings by obtaining meeting links on the RWSC website.\nCurrently, there are limited fine-scale baseline data on abundance and density of sea turtles in the U.S. Atlantic. The primary methodology for determining sea turtle abundance and density is to employ manned aerial surveys, but this methodology is not designed to detect small individuals such as the Kemp’s ridley turtle that is critically endangered. The appropriate variables for describing baseline behavior, physiology, and distribution have not been established. Without established baselines effective for all species and size classes, assessing and mitigating effects of offshore wind on sea turtles will be extremely difficult.\nFew large-scale ongoing or proposed offshore wind studies include sea turtles as the target species group. The Offshore Wind & Wildlife Research Database captures targeted studies of sea turtles and offshore wind, offshore wind studies where sea turtle data may be recorded in an ancillary fashion, and existing and long-term sea turtle monitoring programs that were not specifically designed to measure potential offshore wind impacts. Where sea turtles will be studied as an ancillary research target, it is unclear how or whether sea turtle data will be analyzed.\nThe Subcommittee recommends the following regional-scale data collection efforts for sea turtles (recommendations appropriate for other taxa are labeled as cross taxa):\n\nUse expert input to develop standardized data collection methods to quantify impacts of offshore wind on sea turtles in the context of limited baseline data and climate change effects.\n(Cross taxa) Leveraging BOEM’s ongoing efforts, ensure that the required Protected Species Observer data collected by offshore wind companies during construction and operations described within mitigation plans (e.g., Pile Driving Monitoring Plans and Vessel Strike Avoidance Plans) follow 1) a consistent reporting approach, 2) are eventually submitted to a designated repository and are available for use in sea turtle research, mitigation, and management.\nIncrease data collection on sea turtle species at the regional-scale for a variety of baseline parameters through new and existing federal partnerships (e.g., BOEM’s Environmental Studies Program, AMAPPS, U.S. Navy projects, NMFS projects).\n(Cross taxa) Align new data collection activities with the objectives in the NOAA Fisheries and BOEM Federal Survey Mitigation Strategy (Hare et al., 2022). Review the strategy where it directly addresses sea turtle survey needs and support the development of a Northeast Survey Mitigation Program and similar efforts for the Southeast Region.\n(Cross taxa) Once protocols are developed for assessing sea turtle baseline parameters using consistent phase-gradient experimental designs, prioritize data collection at individual project areas during construction, operation, and demolition to determine if activities displace or attract sea turtles.\n(Cross-taxa) Coordinate regular high-definition aerial surveys that cover multiple lease areas using comparable tools and methods. This effort should leverage the considerable amount of high-definition aerial photography data collected during site assessment by multiple offshore wind developers.\nEmploy NOAA Fisheries recommendations to enhance AMAPPS loggerhead turtle abundance estimates (NOAA Fisheries, 2020) and expand detection studies to all sea turtle species and sizes under a variety of conditions.\nCollect surface time and dive data on all species in all subregions, and appropriate seasons, to contribute to baseline knowledge of 3D distribution, dive behavior, and surface time/availability estimates that can be used to inform sea turtle surface density models.\nCollaborate with additional partners to facilitate data and information sharing, including the Sea Turtle Stranding and Salvage Network, organizations conducting sea turtle nest monitoring, sea turtle rescue organizations operating under USFWS permits and authorization as well as researchers collecting satellite, acoustic, and other tag data.\n\nTechnology needed to improve sea turtle detection and access:\n\nDevelop and test smaller tags with depth sensors capable of surface time calculations for availability bias calculations in smaller turtles.\nDevelop and test (non-archival) tags and/or tag attachment techniques with low drag for capture/release in difficult (offshore) environments.\nDevelop and test remote tag attachment techniques for in-water work.\nContinue development, testing, and deployment of safe, long term external attachment and/or internal insertion methods (Innis et al., 2023) for acoustic tags on sea turtles in order to efficiently make use of this resource.\n(Cross taxa) Develop and test eDNA assays/surveys/sampling regimes to understand efficacy of use in developing indices of occurrence/abundance, including testing the effect of carcasses in the environment on eDNA detection.\n\nEach subregion has differences in both sea turtle occurrence and the scale and timeline of offshore wind development. Subregion specific recommendations are:\nIn the Gulf of Maine, where floating offshore wind development is planned, but where development areas are still being identified, baseline data collection is needed. Small, focused studies on individual animal movement and behavior that are site specific may be the most effective strategies for assessing impacts. Data collection in this subregion should include efforts to characterize and monitor gelatinous prey (i.e., jellyfish and ctenophores) as it is unclear how/whether floating turbines will affect this important sea turtle prey group.\nIn Southern New England and the New York/New Jersey Bight, approved offshore wind projects pose the first opportunity to study sea turtle behavior during construction and operation and to identify potential impacts to sea turtles. It is unclear whether baseline abundance/density data for loggerhead and leatherback turtles in this subregion will be sufficient to detect changes or attribute causes of detected changes in abundance/density using distance sampling techniques. Thus, data collection should focus within and distant from the project envelopes in this subregion and should also include vessel corridors. Turbine construction activities are designed to avoid times when critically endangered North Atlantic right whales were historically in the area (January-April), but these limitations may not avoid the times of highest sea turtle occurrence.\nIn the U.S. Central Atlantic subregion, it appears that there is little voluntary sea turtle research or monitoring associated with offshore wind projects with the exeception of the Maryland Offshore Wind project (U.S. Wind lease). This subregion, however, is likely to have 1) higher turtle densities of most species, 2) longer seasonal sea turtle occurrence and 3) active breeding and nesting adults compared with projects to the north. In addition, restrictions on turbine construction activities designed to avoid critically endangered right whales will mean that construction will occur when densities for most sea turtle species in subregion are highest. Impact studies and data collection in the U.S. Central Atlantic subregion should be focused in and adjacent to lease areas and nearby vessel corridors.\nAll four sea turtle species have a year-round presence in the U.S. Southeast Atlantic which provides foraging, nesting, and breeding habitat for all species. However, there are currently no ongoing or planned research projects related to offshore wind and sea turtles in the RWSC Database in this subregion."

Design for the studies below should be tailored to detect and understand potential effects on sea turtles specifically, with other wildlife data to be collected ancillary to the target species.\nInform where new data collection is needed:\n\nUse expert input to assess experimental design and develop data analysis methods and parameters to quantify impacts of offshore wind on sea turtles in the context of multiple data streams, limited baseline data, and climate change effects.\nDetermine/describe useful baseline parameters for sea turtle distribution and behavior to be used where abundance/density data are not available.\nDevelop robust vertical water column use understanding for all sea turtle species in all subregions and seasons to assist in the development of baseline behavior and abundance estimates for sea turtle species.\nAnalyze datasets collected for other focal species for sea turtle species presence (e.g., high-definition aerial imagery, eDNA).\nDetermine the efficacy of acoustic telemetry for sea turtles, especially if internal tag placement is accepted as a methodology in sea turtles (Innis et al., 2023).\n\nIdentify concerns/hindrances of acoustic telemetry deployment on turtles (permitting, attachment options, turtle access, etc.).\nWork with other user groups to understand and improve receiver deployment (designs) and share data.\n\n\nCharacterize oceanographic and habitat drivers of sea turtle distribution, abundance, and behavior:\n\nCoordinate with federal agencies (U.S. Navy, NOAA Fisheries) to help update and refine sea turtle abundance/density estimates and surface density models.\n\nIntegrate the latest observational and environmental data every 2-3 years.\nIntegrate data from multiple additional methods (strandings, digital aerial surveys, tagging, fishery and dredge take data) and covariates (oceanographic and prey distribution).

    "section": "7.2 Data collection",
    "text": "7.2 Data collection\nThere is a lack of baseline data on most protected fish species and all their life stages in areas where offshore wind projects will or may occur. The lack of baseline data is compounded by the varied and unknown impacts to these species from climatic change. An urgent priority is to improve understanding of distribution and movement for most life stages in wind energy areas so that it is possible to properly assess, monitor, and mitigate any impacts. The Subcommittee recommends using multi-modal approaches (telemetry, eDNA, trawl surveys, aerial surveys) to fill data gaps, though acoustic and satellite telemetry appear to be the quickest and most effective means to enhance understanding. The Subcommittee stresses the importance of relying on local experts as the ecosystems differ greatly throughout the region, as does protected fish use of each wind energy area. Each individual project becomes even more valuable when data can be compared and integrated at broader scales.\nSeveral entities are requiring, funding, and/or advocating for protected fish species research and data collection activities with respect to offshore wind. All ongoing and planned activities, including protected fish species monitoring that is required by agencies, are captured in the Offshore Wind & Wildlife Research Database. To scope future studies, the Subcommittee is guided by earlier research on protected fish species and their interactions with wind energy areas in both Europe and the United States. The descriptions of potential effects to protected fish such as underwater noise, vessel collision, entanglement, introduction of new structures, and electromagnetic fields are summarized in the Environmental Effects of U.S. Offshore Wind Energy Development: Compilation of Educational Research Briefs (SEER, 2022) and the Synthesis of the Science (Hogan et al., 2023). The gaps and needs are captured in the Atlantic Offshore Wind Environmental Research Recommendations(Regional Synthesis Workgroup of the Environmental Technical Working Group, n.d.) as well as (Hogan et al., 2023).\nMost offshore-wind-specific monitoring to-date of protected fish species in the U.S. Atlantic is occurring in Southern New England and the New York/New Jersey Bight on Atlantic sturgeon (Frisk et al., 2019; Haulsee et al., 2020; Ingram et al., 2019; Rothermel et al., 2020), with the goal of characterizing baseline distribution and movement. In the Gulf of Maine, protected fish species monitoring at the University of Maine’s Vulturn US 1:8 floating turbine indicated no change in the detection frequency of tagged Atlantic salmon, Atlantic Sturgeon, or shortnose sturgeon on receivers near the turbine following energization (Brady, 2015). There are also significant and ongoing data collection efforts in estuaries and coastal areas throughout the RWSC study area. While most of these efforts are not explicitly related to offshore wind, their findings can be used to augment the baseline understanding of protected fish species in the region.\nSurveys conducted by the NOAA Fisheries Northeast Fisheries Science Center that may be relevant to protected fish include:\n\nAutumn bottom trawl survey\nSpring bottom trawl survey\nGulf of Maine Cooperative Bottom Longline Survey\nEcosystem Monitoring Survey (target of 6 times per year)\nCoastal Shark Bottom Longline Survey\nCooperative Atlantic States Shark Pupping and Nursery Longline/Gillnet Survey\n\nThe Subcommittee recognizes that protected fish species may be caught as bycatch in commercial fish trawl surveys (and other gear surveys) conducted by offshore wind companies. Whether caught as bycatch or in dedicated protected fish species surveys, individuals and entities should consult with the Protected Fish Species Subcommittee prior to collecting protected fish species data related to offshore wind monitoring to ensure that any new efforts are not duplicative and are consistent with the tools and approaches already in use. Any individual or entity may join public Protected Fish Species Subcommittee meetings by obtaining meeting links on the RWSC website, where all past meeting materials are also available.\nThe Subcommittee recommends the following data collection activities:\n\nDeploy fine-scale acoustic receiver arrays in and around every leased and proposed Wind Energy Area and along associated cable routes. Pair deployments with acoustic and satellite tagging of protected fish.\n\nPlan and implement telemetry data collection activities in a consistent way, such that data and metadata from individual projects is standardized and interoperable.\nExpand projects like Buoys of Opportunity across the region to co-locate acoustic receivers to structures already in/going in the water.\nCouple on-bottom deployment of acoustic receivers with bottom temperature measurements to the extent possible.\nEncourage all new tags/groups to submit data to the Animal Telemetry Network and/or appropriate regional nodes in an agreed upon time frame to allow for archiving, securing, and publishing. \n\nDesign a distributed region wide system of receiver arrays that serve as the backbone for projects throughout the region. This includes receivers offshore/along the shelf, which are limited in the current project landscape.\n\nEnsure that this system has sustained investment for operation and maintenance.\nEncourage all new tags/groups to submit data to the Animal Telemetry Network and/or appropriate regional nodes in an agreed upon time frame to allow for archiving, securing, and publishing.\n\nPair additional methods with telemetry data collection, including conventional tagging (i.e., non-electronic), eDNA, and aerial surveys to aid the identification of changes in residency or usage of the area.\nEvaluate the risks of known impact producing factors to protected fish from offshore wind development.\n\nDevelop tools and monitoring mechanisms to better understand if/when vessel strikes occur and what vessels are typically involved.\n\nCoordinate with state agencies for recorded information on protected fish sightings, incidental catches, and beach strandings, particularly Atlantic and shortnose sturgeon.\nEnsure sufficient human and financial support for local salvage operations.\nCreate and test mitigation measures to prevent vessel strikes.\n\nConduct further laboratory and field studies of EMF effects on protected fish species, especially Chondrichthyes and sturgeons, to assess potential impacts including changes in migration patterns, feeding, or behavior. Conduct similar studies on protected fish prey species.\nConduct in situ examinations of noise impacts to protected fish species.\nAssess primary and secondary entanglement risk to all protected fish species given the potential for increased recreational fishing near wind turbines and increased possibility of secondary entanglement. \n\nAlign data collection and research activities with the recommendations in the NOAA Fisheries & BOEM Federal Survey Mitigation Strategy (Hare et al., 2022).\nCollaborate with other Subcommittees to maximize data collection efforts.\n\nMarine Mammal: maintain a shareable database and/or map of the acoustic telemetry receivers that may be co-located with bottom-mounted passive acoustic hydrophones.\nTechnology: Test and implement any technological advancements that may be required to continue long-standing scientific surveys and data collection in areas that are no longer accessible or are accessible in a limited extent that will influence continuity of surveys.\nSea Turtle: Ensure that sea turtle researchers can access telemetry receiver data if desired.\nHabitat and Ecosystem: Work to ensure that key oceanographic and habitat data are collected and available to use in coordination with studies on protected fish. \n\n\nTechnology advancements to improve protected fish research and monitoring:\n\nDevelop and test telemetry tags with further miniaturization for use with smaller individuals.\nImprove data resolution and positional accuracy of telemetry tags and test adding sensors (magnetometers, sound, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll, etc.) to existing tags.\nInvestigate the use of eDNA to measure species abundance in addition to occurrence.\nImprove or develop machine learning and/or Artificial Intelligence detection for soniferous protected fish in passive acoustic data.\n\nIn the Gulf of Maine, where offshore wind projects are still in the planning phases, baseline data about the occurrence, distribution, and movement of protected fish species is needed. Floating offshore structures include cables and mooring lines that span the entire water column, including some that emit EMFs. Potential effects from EMF and secondary entanglement should be monitored. Focal species in these regions include Atlantic salmon, Atlantic sturgeon and shortnose sturgeon. The oceanic whitetip shark and giant manta ray may also be found in this region.\nIn Southern New England and New York/New Jersey Bight, existing baseline data collection from multiple tools such as acoustic telemetry, satellite telemetry, eDNA, and trawl surveys, need to be better integrated to characterize protected fish species’ distribution and movement pre-offshore wind construction. These data should also continue to be collected throughout all phases of development to characterize changes from pre-construction baselines. Focal species in these regions include Atlantic sturgeon and shortnose sturgeon. The oceanic whitetip shark and giant manta ray are also found in this region.\nIn the U.S. Central Atlantic and U.S. Southeast Atlantic, baseline data collection on the occurrence, distribution, and movement of protected fish is most urgent in the U.S. Central Atlantic where projects are farther along in the development process. The U.S. Central Atlantic is home to the Atlantic sturgeon, shortnose sturgeon, giant manta ray, and whitespotted eagle ray. These species are also present in the U.S. Southeast Atlantic, in addition to the listed Central & Southwest Atlantic distinct population segments of scalloped hammerhead shark, Nassau grouper, and smalltooth sawfish."

    "text": "8.2 Data Collection\nOceanographic and meteorological data collection is being collected widely given its inherent value to offshore wind developers to inform engineering and operational decisions. Several other entities are also funding, and/or advocating for oceanographic research and data collection activities with respect to offshore wind, in many cases due to the relevance to megafauna and their prey. Ongoing and planned activities are captured in the Offshore Wind & Wildlife Research Database.\nEntities that deploy platforms to collect oceanographic and meteorological data in and near offshore wind development sites should coordinate with the IOOS RAs to manage and disseminate those data, in real-time, as is feasible. Links to where those data can be accessed should be shared with the RWSC Habitat & Ecosystem Subcommittee as soon as possible. Several offshore wind developers have or are actively coordinating with the IOOS RAs to serve real-time oceanographic and meteorological data from platforms within their lease areas approved by BOEM as part of their Site Assessment Plans. Links below point to active or legacy data:\n\nBeacon Wind (Equinor)\nEmpire Wind (Equinor)\nAtlantic Shores Offshore Wind\nSouthCoast Wind\n\nThe Subcommittee recommends the following data collection activities :\n\nLeverage, maintain awareness, and coordinate with existing data collection programs that characterize baseline hydrodynamic and oceanographic processes, including:\n\nLong-term surveys, datasets, and syntheses that inform the NOAA Fisheries State of the Ecosystem Reports Northeast U.S. Shelf (updated annually) and the Northeast Integrated Ecosystem Assessment.\nCoastal Data Information Program (CDIP)\nNational Data Buoy Center (NDBC)\nU.S. IOOS High Frequency Radar Network\nNational Water Level Observation Network (NWLON)\nDatasets routinely collected by other agencies, including the National Weather Service, U.S. Navy, and others.\n\nCollect oceanographic (and for above-water species, meteorological) data simultaneously to wildlife observation data collection activities to provide context and understand potential drivers of wildlife distribution, abundance, behavior, movement, and health.\n\nLeverage existing IOOS RA infrastructure, including co-locating sensors.\nA list of key oceanographic and meteorological variables, parameters, and platforms/methods is provided in the Appendix. Many of these variables are recognized by the Global Ocean Observing System as Essential Ocean Variables (EOV). The list also specifies whether the variable was identified by RWSC Subcommittees as a potentially useful covariate for species distribution modeling (Hogan et al., 2023; MDAT, 2017; Roberts et al., 2016).\nEnsure that oceanographic/meteorological data collected during offshore wind and wildlife surveys/studies is compiled and made available for use in other analyses and research.\n\nCollect meteorological, hydrographic, oceanographic, and productivity data in a consistent way from the fine- to regional scales to informs models (see Data Analysis) and produce a collection of standardized data products for priority species modeling covariates:\n\nSee the list of key variables, parameters, and platforms/methods in the Appendix.\nEnsure that hydrodynamic and oceanographic processes are consistently measured across the RWSC study area.\nProcesses of interest for which data should be collected for modeling (training and validation) include:\n\nMid-Atlantic cold pool formation; stratification in general\nLocal turbulence production and induced mixing of different offshore wind foundation structures\nWater quality and light penetration (e.g., chemical contamination associated with increased vessel traffic and presence of offshore wind structures, effects on suspended particulate matter and turbidity)\nAtmospheric effects associated with energy removal by wind turbines (e.g., wake effects, the effects on waves, currents, and other air-sea interactions)\nWind farm-induced flow and atmospheric response to both momentum and heat fluxes\nAmbient soundscapes and sound propagation data\nPhytoplankton composition/biomass/abundance, primary productivity, and change over time; occurrence and persistence of harmful algal blooms\nZooplankton composition/biomass/abundance, secondary productivity, and change over time\nFood availability for filter feeders and links to higher trophic levels\n\nWhere appropriate, using observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs) to determine optimal location of oceanographic observing at the region-wide scale.\n\nCoordinate with the IOOS RAs and RWSC Subcommittees that may be deploying instrumentation via buoys to strategically co-locate sensors for oceanographic, meteorological, and habitat data.\nInvesting in region wide data collection with AUVs and remote sensing, including gliders, to supplement buoy data and collect more seamless broad scale coverage of physical oceanographic and biogeochemical data, and to record ambient noise.\n\nIdentify reliable reference/control sites, which may also be areas of high ecosystem productivity, for long-term monitoring and baseline data collection of multiple oceanographic variables in areas outside of wind lease areas.\n\nAdvance technologies that facilitate widespread oceanographic and meteorological data collection, transmission, and data management during all phases of offshore wind development, and to ensure that the performance of new technologies is evaluated consistently (see Technology chapter recommendations).\n\nDevelop, test, and validate novel platforms for collecting oceanographic and meteorological data\nLeverage existing and improve real-time data transmission technologies from offshore platforms (cost, availability, reliability)\n\n\nThe Gulf of Maine is warming faster than 99% of the world’s oceans (Pershing et al., 2015). Oceanographic effects of floating turbines may differ from those of bottom-mounted turbines because of differences in structures spanning the whole water column (mooring lines vs. foundations). In this subregion there are gaps in understanding of the potential impacts on physical and biological resources from hydrodynamic and atmospheric alterations due to turbine presence (Blair et al., 2022). There are currently relatively few federal ocean observing buoys collecting data in the Gulf of Maine planning area, especially in the deepest basins where offshore wind development is most likely. Oceanographic observations in the planning area should be increased to characterize baselines, disentangle climate signals, and measure potential effects from offshore wind development.\nConstruction- and post-construction wildlife monitoring in Southern New England, New York/New Jersey Bight, and U.S. Central Atlantic should include oceanographic data collection. The Mid-Atlantic Cold Pool will likely be a focus of data collection and studies given its dynamic nature and influence on food webs in these subregions. However, there are few federal ocean observing assets in the deeper waters of the RWSC study area. Additional platforms will be coming online in the MA/RI Wind Energy Area associated with the Wind Forecast Improvement Project 3 in late 2023 and early 2024, and there is the opportunity to co-locate sensors with the expansion of the Passive Acoustic Monitoring Network (see the Marine Mammal chapter. Given the area covered by multiple contiguous leases in these locations, it will be important to collect data consistently such that cumulative impacts from multiple wind farms on oceanography and habitat can be studied. Studies to characterize hydrodynamics of Nantucket Shoals and other important megafauna foraging habitats (e.g., coastal New Jersey) should monitor potential impacts from climate change-driven shifts in oceanography and physical forcing, as well as human activities to separate any impacts from those associated with offshore wind development.\nResearch efforts in the U.S. Southeast Atlantic should focus on areas that are the likely targets of wind development (i.e., the northern third to one-half of the subregion). Upwelling is an important process in this subregion where seasonal stratification and Ekman transport push deep Gulf Stream waters onshore. These nutrient-rich deep waters drive productivity in the U.S. Southeast Atlantic, but overall, relationships between seasonal oceanographic forcing and biological responses in this subregion are active areas of research. Data collection and modeling should focus on the potential effects from wakes on cross-shelf transport and resulting impacts to the ecology of the subregion."

    "text": "9.2 Data Collection\nSeafloor data collection is funded and implemented by multiple entities that participate in RWSC. Ongoing and planned activities are captured in the Offshore Wind & Wildlife Research Database.  For offshore wind companies, geophysical site characterization activities (i.e., seafloor mapping and data collection) inform multiple aspects of project development including engineering and risk assessment. Overall, the precise types of field data collection, processing, and analysis activities conducted by offshore wind companies are not well-known or consistent with respect to spatial coverage, applied methods, and sampled parameters. Geophysical site assessment information is often redacted in Construction and Operations Plans (COPs) posted to BOEM’s website. From a review of publicly available COPs (see Seafloor Appendix), seafloor acoustic, imagery, and grab methods are often not applied consistently, and the footprints of investigations vary from within the wind lease area and along proposed export cable paths to land, only areas with proposed wind turbine generator locations, and, in some cases, areas beyond the lease area’s boundaries. This Subcommittee will continue to help inform any needed improvements to the standardization of seafloor data collection and dissemination across offshore wind projects.\nAside from data collected by commercial entities, the Subcommittee will coordinate with and leverage existing and ongoing efforts by multiple groups to identify geographic data gaps in high-resolution seafloor mapping data (U.S. Interagency Working Group on Ocean and Coastal Mapping; National Ocean Mapping, Exploration, and Characterization Council (NOMEC); Northeast Regional Ocean Council Habitat Classification and Ocean Mapping Subcommittee). These groups produce regular updates to data gaps assessments and publish map products that help guide new data collection. A current map showing survey coverage of digital soundings data (i.e., seafloor acoustic data) is available via the NCEI Bathymetric Data Viewer. In consideration of this information and evolving prioritizations, the Subcommittee recommends general areas where new seafloor data collection is needed:\n\nOutside the boundaries of offshore wind leases throughout the RWSC study area.\nContinental shelf waters further from shore, including central and eastern Gulf of Maine and offshore Southern New England waters.\nWaters off the shelf near the BOEM Central Atlantic Planning areas.\n\nThe Subcommittee also recommends the following activities:\n\nDevelop recommended practices for consistent post-construction benthic monitoring to ensure regional compatibility of site-specific data:\n\nStatistical frameworks to guide sampling design, including the spatial and temporal extents over which effects can be detected.\nFrequency of sampling, including adaptive sampling after storms or other acute disturbances (e.g., nearby construction activity).\nConsistent methods to identify appropriate reference locations and to define “recovery from disturbance.”\nBenthic community variables, ecological functions, and processes of interest (e.g., spawning, larval habitat, recruitment, feeding, growth).\n\nMonitor the transport, occurrence, and prevalence of non-native and invasive species on/via offshore wind infrastructure.\nCharacterize biological colonization (i.e., sessile, attached, and epiphytic flora and fauna) of new structures, the marine communities they attract and support, and any associated biogeochemical changes to the surrounding environment (e.g., nutrient enrichment, carbon burial).\nPeriodically re-evaluate and standardize data collection and field methods to ensure collected data are suitable for regional needs.\nAdvance, evaluate, and apply new technologies and techniques to support seafloor data collection and habitat mapping analyses:\n\nAutonomous seafloor mapping platforms.\nNon-extractive sampling techniques (e.g., imagery, video, eDNA).\nArtificial intelligence for image classification (e.g., NOAA NCCOS Enhancing Habitat Mapping Accuracy and Efficiency Using Artificial Intelligence).\n\n\nIn the Gulf of Maine, there is almost no modern high-resolution seafloor data overlapping with the newly released draft Wind Energy Area. A few groups are working to address this (NOAA Deep Sea Coral Research and Technology Program, Northeast Regional Ocean Council Habitat Classification and Ocean Mapping Subcommittee), but additional geophysical and seafloor sampling data should be collected to establish baseline seafloor habitat characterizations.\nOf the active offshore wind leases in Southern New England and the New York/New Jersey Bight, several publicly available COPs provide information about seafloor data collection. Collaborative work with respect to developing data sharing workflows and recommendations for standardization should leverage this available information as a case study. Lessons learned from the data collection and monitoring of the Block Island Wind Farm should be applied here. With construction ongoing in these subregions, studies should seek to characterize the effects of construction activities on seafloor environments and benthic communities, the colonization of new structures, and how far any effects are felt from these activities (spatially and temporally).\nLessons learned from the seafloor data collection and monitoring of the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind Pilot project should be applied to studies in the U.S. Central Atlantic. Data collection outside the active leases in the area is needed, as most active projects are currently focused in lease areas.\nThere are limited field data collection activities occurring in the U.S. Southeast Atlantic and no publicly available COPs for offshore wind projects as of January 2024.\n\n\n\nRegional scale sediment map for Southern New England produced using multiple individual sediment and bathymetry data sources.

    "text": "10.1 Introduction\nThe RWSC Steering Committee identified the need for a Technology Subcommittee to provide a forum for wildlife and marine science experts to discuss potential applications, key questions, and challenges related to the use of technology in wildlife/environment monitoring with members of the tech-startup, marine technology, and ocean engineering communities.\nThis Subcommittee, first convened in April 2023, is building off and includes membership from existing groups and efforts to test and advance technology with respect to offshore wind and wildlife/environment monitoring:\n\nMarine Technology Society: The Marine Technology Society promotes awareness, understanding, and the advancement and application of marine technology. Incorporated in 1963, the international society brings together businesses, institutions, professionals, academics, and students who are ocean engineers, technologists, policy makers, and educators. The Society publishes a peer-reviewed journal — The Marine Technology Society Journal. It has 31 Professional Committees (technical interest groups), including the newly-formed Offshore Renewable Energy Committee. The Committee promotes the use of marine technology innovation and research in the rapidly growing offshore renewable energy community. To do this the Committee will provide a forum for communication and networking events that facilitate the exchange of information, including discussion of relevant marine technology applications, training and education opportunities.\nNational Offshore Wind Research & Development Consortium (NOWRDC): a nationally focused, not-for-profit organization collaborating with industry on prioritized R&D activities to reduce the levelized cost of energy of offshore wind in the U.S. while maximizing other economic and social benefits. The Consortium is focused on, but not limited to, technology advancement in each of three initial research pillars: Offshore Wind Farm Technology Advancement; Offshore Wind Power Resource and Physical Site Characterization; and Installation, Operations and Maintenance, and Supply Chain.\nTechnology needs for scientifically robust wildlife monitoring and adaptive management: A project conducted by Advisian and the Biodiversity Research Institute, funded by NOWRDC. This project, which culminates in August 2023, will make targeted recommendations for technology development around priority questions with respect to marine mammals and birds in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Great Lakes for fixed and floating offshore wind projects.\nWind Energy Monitoring and Mitigation Technologies Tool: A free, online tool to catalog monitoring and mitigating technologies developed to assess and reduce potential wildlife impacts resulting from land-based and offshore wind energy development. Initiated by the International Energy Agency Wind Task 34 – Working Together to Resolve Environmental Effects of Wind Energy (WREN) the tool provides the research status of technologies to ensure the international community has access to current, publicly available information on monitoring and mitigation solutions, their state of development, and related research on their effectiveness. Reviewed on a biannual basis.\nOffshore Wind Innovation Hub: The New York-based Offshore Wind Innovation Hub was launched by Equinor, together with its partner bp. The hub will facilitate partnerships with start-ups that bring new technological solutions to the rapidly growing U.S. offshore wind industry. The initiative will begin as a three-year partnership between Equinor, the Urban Future Lab at the New York University Tandon School of Engineering, and NOWRDC, supported by New York City Economic Development Corporation.\nGreentown Labs Go Energize 2023: Greentown Labs, the largest climate tech incubator in North America, and Vineyard Wind, developer of the first utility-scale offshore wind farm in the United States, are collaborating on Greentown Go Energize 2023, a program supported by the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center, aimed at startups that are innovating solutions for offshore turbine monitoring and ecological data collection, as well as digital solutions to improve turbine efficiency and longevity.\n\nTechnology Subcommittee members representing these existing initiatives and others from states, federal agencies, eNGOs, offshore wind companies, consulting companies, and the research community emphasized the need to continue employing both traditional methods with new technologies for both validation purposes and to provide additional context or data that new technologies cannot provide. The Subcommittee identified the following high-level themes for their future work. The purpose of this chapter is to further frame these themes and identify near-term actions to advance them.\n\nTechnology advancements provide the potential to accelerate multiple phases of offshore wind development by improving our ability to anticipate, detect, and mitigate potential impacts to wildlife and the ecosystem.\nThere are three categories of interest to the Subcommittee where new technologies need to be tested and applied: monitoring, mitigation, and data management. Many projects are already being funded to test and/or advance new technologies for the purposes of offshore wind and wildlife/environment within these categories, and the Subcommittee should continue to track the implementation and results of such projects.\nThere is a need to develop criteria to evaluate the effectiveness of new technology with respect to “traditional methods” or other new technologies."

    "text": "10.2 Technology advancements to accelerate offshore wind development and ensure minimal impacts to wildlife and the ecosystem\nSeveral members of the Subcommittee felt strongly that the testing and advancement of new technologies should be focused on enabling faster timelines for multiple phases of offshore wind development, including permitting and mitigation during construction. Technologies that would address this goal include:\n\nPredictive modeling to anticipate potential wildlife occurrence in wind energy areas.\nSystems that improve wildlife detection rates in both space and time, allowing for more rapid mitigation responses.\nTools and systems that deter wildlife or mitigate potential stressors such as noise, electromagnetic fields, entanglement from abandoned, lost, or otherwise discarded fishing gear, and physical disturbance.\n\nOther applications of technology that are of interest to the Subcommittee include the advancement of long-term monitoring methods and streamlining research data collection. Given the scale of proposed offshore wind development, experts noted that consistent data collection across the RWSC study area will be more attainable with the adoption of new technologies. Already, tools like gliders and un-crewed systems (air and water) are covering more ground offshore than would be possible with traditional ship-based sampling or fixed-bottom sensors.\nAccelerating sustainable and responsible offshore wind development will require critical technology enhancements. However, the Technology Subcommittee acknowledges that as investments in new technologies continue, there is a need for new approaches to be objectively tested for their efficacy and value over or in addition to traditional methods. The Subcommittee expressed a goal to advance a multi-sector discussion and development of criteria for technology evaluation. The second theme of this chapter describes ongoing and planned projects that are advancing and testing new monitoring, mitigation, and data management technologies. Following that inventory, the Subcommittee presents high-level categories under which specific metrics for technology performance evaluation could be developed under theme three."

    "text": "10.3 Ongoing and planned activities within the three categories of technology applications\nThe Technology Subcommittee identified three categories of new technology where testing and evaluation may be needed: monitoring, mitigation, and data management. Many projects are already being funded to test and/or advance new technologies with respect to offshore wind and wildlife/environment within these categories. This section summarizes those efforts. The Marine Mammal, Sea Turtle, Bird, Bat, Oceanography, Seafloor, and Protected Fish Species chapters of this Plan describe the applications of accepted technologies and methods for monitoring, mitigation, and data management (e.g., real-time passive acoustic sensors paired with whale detection algorithms) and recommendations for future technology development and applications pertinent to the study of wildlife and the environment. This Technology chapter focuses on tools and methods that are still undergoing evaluation for usefulness and efficacy.\nThe Technology Subcommittee will continue to lead discussions with the other Subcommittees with respect to advancing new technologies. RWSC will provide the forum for conversations that require input from wildlife biologists and ecologists and technology experts and providers.\nThe Subcommittee is aware that some entities may not wish to share their ongoing or planned work on technology advancement for commercial purposes. Therefore, the content in this section is assumed to be incomplete.\n\n10.3.1 Monitoring\nMonitoring activities include the required and voluntary data collection activities that seek to characterize wildlife presence, distribution, abundance, behavior, movement, and health, as well as benthic and pelagic habitat features that could be affected by offshore wind development or drive changes in species presence, distribution, abundance, behavior, movement, and health.\nTable 10.

For example, integrating passive acoustic monitoring, radar systems, and unmanned aerial vehicles could enable an above-and-below water 3D real-time monitoring capability, which could lead to faster adaptive management. Artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques offer the potential to enhance species detection and identification, potentially improving the speed of mitigation applications. The cost-effectiveness of mitigation measures needs to be carefully evaluated to ensure their feasibility broad scales.\nTable 11.

Environmental Data Analysis: R and Python (along with other statistical packages).\nSoftware Tools for the Mitigation of Wind Turbine HF Radar Interference in the U.S. IOOS Network\n\n\n\n\n\n10.3.3 Data Management Technologies\nThe effective collection, storage, and security of data play a crucial role in wildlife monitoring and mitigation efforts in offshore wind environments.\nThe Data Governance and Data Management chapter of the Science Plan describes the existing and needed processes and components of effective and collaborative offshore wind environmental data management but does not propose specific technological solutions. The Data Governance Subcommittee can work together with the Technology Subcommittee to ensure that RWSC is recommending and pursuing appropriate and effective technological solutions for data management. This section briefly describes the different components of environmental data management where technology advancements could improve existing workflows.\n\n10.3.3.1 Local Data Storage\n\nWhere real-time transmission is not required or feasible, data storage devices such as data loggers, memory cards, or hard drives collect and store data from sensors and monitoring devices (e.g., buoys, animal tags and receivers). These devices are then physically transported back to onshore facilities for data retrieval and analysis.\nHigh-capacity storage devices and long-lasting batteries enable longer deployments.\n\n\n\n10.3.3.2 Data transfer/transmission\n\nSubsea Cables: Cabled monitoring devices tethered to onshore data centers or monitoring stations provide reliable and high-bandwidth data transfer. Offshore wind projects include numerous subsea cables (interarray and to shore) to transmit power and in some cases, data.\nAcoustic modems and optical modems can transfer data from the collection device to another storage device for transportation to shore, eliminating the need to remove the device from wherever it is mounted (underwater or atop a turbine, for example).\nWireless Networks: The LoRaWAN® specification enables wireless connectivity for battery-operated devices in regional or global networks, supporting IoT requirements. The LoRaWAN® specification is a Low Power Wide Area (LPWA) networking protocol designed to wirelessly connect battery-operated to the Internet in regional, national, or global networks. It targets critical Internet of Things (IoT) requirements such as bi-directional communication, end-to-end security, mobility, and localization services. In some cases, offshore wind installations may utilize subsea cables that connect monitoring devices to onshore data centers or monitoring stations. These cables provide a reliable and high-bandwidth connection for continuous data transfer.\nSatellite modems (e.g., iridium) transmit data to shore via satellite. Frequency of transmissions is limited by cost.\nRemote sensing techniques, such as HF Radar and satellite imagery rely on satellite communication networks to transmit collected data.\n\n\n\n10.3.3.3 Secure Data Transfer, Access Control, and Backup\n\nSecure Data Transfer: Encrypted connections and secure file transfer protocols ensure data confidentiality and integrity during transmission. Secure data transfer protocols are used to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of data during transmission between offshore platforms and onshore facilities. Encrypted connections and secure file transfer protocols (e.g., SFTP, FTPS) are commonly employed to protect data during transit.\nAccess Control and User Permissions: User authentication, role-based access control, and data segregation strategies manage user permissions and data security. Access control mechanisms are implemented to manage user permissions and control who can access, modify, or retrieve specific datasets. User authentication, role-based access control (RBAC), and data segregation strategies are employed to ensure data security and privacy.\nData Backup and Disaster Recovery: Regular backup procedures and disaster recovery plan to safeguard against data loss and ensure data resilience.\nRegular data backup procedures are essential to prevent data loss due to technical failures, system malfunctions, or unforeseen events. Offshore wind data management systems often include backup strategies and disaster recovery plans to ensure data resilience and continuity.\n\n\n\n10.3.3.4 Secure Platforms for QA/QC and Review\n\nQA/QC Processes: Standard operating procedures, automated data validation algorithms, and manual review ensure the quality and accuracy of collected data.\nQuality Assurance of Real-Time Oceanographic Data (QARTOD): QA/QC processes are implemented to validate and ensure the quality and accuracy of collected data. This includes establishing standard operating procedures (SOPs) for data collection, entry, and validation. QA/QC checks can involve automated data validation algorithms, manual data review, and cross-validation with reference data sources.   IOOS supports the QARTOD program.\nData Validation Tools: Software applications or scripts automate checks to identify errors or inconsistencies in the data. Data validation tools are software applications or scripts that perform automated checks on the collected data to identify potential errors, inconsistencies, or outliers. These tools can help ensure data quality and flag any anomalies that require further investigation or correction.\nData Review and Auditing: Independent experts or internal review teams systematically examine collected data for accuracy, completeness, and compliance with standards. Data review and auditing involve systematically analyzing the collected data to verify its accuracy, completeness, and compliance with defined standards. This process may involve independent experts or internal review teams assessing the data against specific criteria or industry guidelines.  RWSC Subcommittees could play a role in data review and auditing, leveraging the data management best practices described in each Science Plan chapter.\n\n\n\n10.3.3.5 Data Catalogs and Repositories\nData catalogs, which are hubs for connecting data stored in several distinct locations, are discussed in the Data Governance & Data Management chapter. The technological requirements, capacity, and examples of active data catalogs will be discussed by the Data Governance Subcommittee.\nRepositories store and provide access to data (and may also provide cataloging functions). Existing wildlife and environmental data repositories recommended by each Subcommittee are presented in the previous chapters of the Science Plan. Each Subcommittee also made recommendations for augmenting existing or developing new repositories for emerging data types that don’t currently have a widely used or accepted repository. Several technical features have emerged as important for repositories that may be used to store wildlife and environment offshore wind data:\n\nWeb-based and platform-independent\nCredentialed access to certain components\nLarge volume and efficient data upload/input and download/egress\n\n\n\n10.3.3.6 Other\n\nData Management Tools: Cloud-native data management architecture and tools enhance data management and accessibility. Reaching for the Cloud is a collaboration between IOOS and RPS Group Ocean Science. This project aims to identify the technological and process shifts needed to develop a cloud-native architecture that will serve the current and future needs of the IOOS community.\nCollaborative Projects: Projects such as Reaching for the Cloud and “SoundCoop” focus on developing cloud-native architectures and promoting improved accessibility and applications for data management. Sound Coop, or Passive Acoustic Monitoring National Cyberinfrastructure Center, is a project that is Piloting a community-focused, national cyberinfrastructure capability for passive acoustic monitoring data, technology, and best practices to promote improved, scalable, and sustainable accessibility and applications for management and science.  The RWSC is on the Sound Coop Steering Committee and will be able to both inform and leverage the resulting work."

    "text": "10.4 Potential criteria for evaluating the performance of new technologies for monitoring and mitigation\nAs new technologies and innovations develop on multiple fronts related to offshore wind and wildlife (monitoring, mitigation, data management), the Technology Subcommittee recognizes the need to consistently evaluate any new tools and approaches against traditional methods and alternative technologies.\nTechnology Subcommittee members recommend developing a mutually agreed-upon set of criteria that decision makers, funders, and users of technology can apply and interpret to evaluate the performance of the technology, potential appropriate uses of the technology, and any potential risks associated with applying the new technology.\nA set of evaluation criteria would ensure that new methods and tools are evaluated consistently, fairly, and more efficiently than if custom performance evaluations are conducted each time a new technology emerges. The criteria should be evaluated every few years to ensure that they continue to be relevant and responsive to the needs of decision makers, funders, and users.\nThere are several existing technology evaluation frameworks that the Subcommittee may refer to as it advances its work on this topic:\n\nTechnology Readiness Assessment Guide, U.S. Department of Energy, DOE G 413.3-4A\nGuidance notes on qualifying new technologies, American Bureau of Shipping\nTechnology Assessment Design Handbook, U.S. Government Accountability Office\n\nBelow, the Subcommittee presents draft categories of evaluation criteria for new technologies with respect to offshore wind and wildlife/environment. The Subcommittee recommends convening smaller multi-sector expert work groups to guide and participate in the evaluation of specific tools as the needs arise.\nThe Technology Subcommittee’s latest work and planned events related to Technology Workshops can be found at https://rwsc.org/technology-workshops.\nRWSC is receiving support from several partners across sectors for providing capacity for workshops to advance these recommendations:\n\nRWSC will ensure consistency with Science Plan objectives/recommendations and that RWSC partners have the opportunity to participate.\nThe Marine Technology Society (MTS) will engage their Offshore Renewable Energy Committee and other MTS community members.\nDOE’s National Laboratories (NREL and PNNL), under the leadership of the RWSC and their Technology Subcommittee and in consultation with NOAA, BOEM, and DOE, will convene a group of experts and relevant stakeholders to discuss available whale detection technologies.\nOpportunity to leverage NOWRDC-funded technology gap/readiness analysis by Advisian/BRI – forthcoming report.\nUse next NYSERDA State of the Science Workshop (July 2024) as opportunity to hold workshop sessions and/or technology showcases.\nNOAA & BOEM leadership, ACP, and eNGOs supportive and commit to participate.\n\n\n10.4.1 Potential categories of technology evaluation criteria\n\nAccuracy and Precision\nAdvanced technologies could provide higher accuracy and precision in detecting, identifying, and tracking wildlife species than traditional methods. Technology also allows more consistent and reliable data collection and monitoring, leading to more high-quality data. Potential metrics include false/true positive/negative rates and distance efficacy.\n\n\nEfficiency and Scalability\nTechnology advancements enable more efficient data collection, processing, and storage, allowing for the collection and handling of large volumes of data. This scalability is essential given the extent of proposed offshore wind development in U.S. Atlantic waters.\n\nCost Efficiency\nAs technology advances, costs associated with monitoring, mitigation, and data management can be reduced. This allows for more cost-effective implementation of monitoring programs, making it feasible to adopt advanced technologies and sustain long-term monitoring efforts. A potential metric in this category is cost savings over time.\n\n\nFaster Data Analysis and Interpretation\nTechnology advancements like machine learning and artificial intelligence enhance data analysis and interpretation capabilities. These technologies automate data processing, enabling extracting meaningful insights, identifying patterns, and detecting potential risks or impacts.\n\n\n\nSafety\nNew technologies may provide safer mechanisms for data collection than traditional or manual methods, especially in potentially dangerous conditions offshore. Technology advancements could result in increased deployment and data collection success if humans aren’t required to wait for safe conditions or work in suboptimal conditions.\n\n\nReal-Time Capabilities\nAdvanced technologies offer real-time monitoring capabilities, enabling prompt notification of wildlife presence, behavior changes, or other characteristics. Real-time data can be used to trigger mitigation measures and/or adaptive management promptly, which may result in an overall reduced risk of wildlife interactions and minimized disturbances to sensitive species.\n\n\nMitigation Effectiveness\nTechnology advancements contribute to developing innovative mitigation measures by developing deterrent systems or shutdown protocols that effectively reduce collision risks and minimize wildlife disturbance.\n\n\nSupply Chain\nNew technologies may not be implemented unless the materials and labor force exists for producing components or the entire technology solution.\n\n\nData Integration and Collaboration\nAdvanced technologies promote data integration from multiple sources and platforms, enabling a holistic view of the offshore wind/wildlife/environment system. This integration facilitates collaboration among researchers, wind farm operators, regulators, and conservation organizations, fostering knowledge sharing and effective conservation strategies.\n\n\nData Management and Security\nTechnology advancements enhance data management and security, ensuring the integrity, accessibility, and privacy of collected data. Robust data storage infrastructure, encryption protocols, and access control mechanisms safeguard sensitive information while facilitating data sharing and compliance with data protection regulations.\n\n\nPublic Awareness and Engagement\nTechnology advancements in data visualization and communication tools enable effective dissemination of monitoring results and engage the public in wildlife and ecosystem monitoring. Accessible and engaging communication can raise awareness about the importance of offshore wind/wildlife/environment monitoring and keep the public informed of ongoing data collection and research."

During Science Plan development, Subcommittee meeting agendas included opportunities for participants to provide input on the content of each chapter. All Subcommittee meetings were open to the public, and recordings and meeting summaries are posted publicly.\nThe RWSC developed the Offshore Wind & Wildlife Research Database to capture the ongoing and planned research that participants were sharing during Subcommittee meetings. The Database provided a way for each entity’s research and data collection efforts to be included in the Science Plan by reference. The Subcommittees then used the Database to develop recommendations for data collection and research that should be continued or initiated to fill existing knowledge gaps. Funders and researchers can continue to share information about their work by submitting project information to the Database via an online form.\nFrom June 30 – September 30, 2023, a complete draft of the Science Plan, reflecting the Subcommittees’ recommendations, was made available on the RWSC website for public comment. All interested individuals were invited to provide feedback by filling out an online comment form, uploading a comment letter, and/or uploading edits and annotations to the draft itself.

    "title": "11  Science Plan Review & Revision Process",
    "section": "11.4 Frequently asked questions",
    "text": "11.4 Frequently asked questions\nWhy wasn’t [group] included in the development of the Science Plan?\nThe four sectors (federal agencies, states, eNGOs, and offshore wind companies) invited participation in Science Plan development from any individual or entity via public Subcommittee meetings and the 90-day public comment period. All are welcome to join RWSC Subcommittee discussions and to provide input on research recommendations.\nWhy is [dataset] not mentioned in the Science Plan?\nIt is the Subcommittees’ recommendation that all available data are evaluated for usefulness in new analyses and research. The Science Plan and the Offshore Wind & Wildlife Research Database describe an incredible number of datasets and data collection efforts. Even so, the Subcommittees recognize that these compilations are likely incomplete, both because new efforts are being added continuously, and because there are so many potentially relevant ocean data collection efforts.\nOne challenge encountered by all Subcommittees was to appropriately distinguish between data collection and research activities specifically funded and designed to study offshore wind and wildlife/environment interactions, versus those activities that were not designed to study the potential effects of offshore wind but might still provide useful data in such studies. The Database has been revised to reflect this distinction to the extent practicable, recognizing that some categorizations might not be clear in all cases.\nA consistent recommendation across all Subcommittees is for prospective funders and researchers planning new data collection activities related to offshore wind and wildlife to join a few Subcommittee meetings to ask about existing data and share ideas. These discussions could highlight new or additional datasets not yet described or included in RWSC materials and ensure their inclusion in new work.\nWhy aren’t there any recommendations for fisheries research included in the Science Plan?\nThe scope of the RWSC Science Plan does not include fisheries or commercially managed fish species. For research needs and considerations on those topics, visit the Responsible Offshore Science Alliance (ROSA; https://www.rosascience.org). While both RWSC and ROSA are engaging in regional coordination and advancement of research and monitoring related to interactions between offshore wind and ecosystems, ROSA’s focus is fisheries (commercial and recreational) and RWSC’s focus is wildlife. Each organization exists because issues related to the intersection of offshore wind and fisheries often differ from those of wildlife and endangered species. To ensure close coordination on issues in the RWSC Science Plan that might relate with ROSA’s work, ROSA staff participate in the RWSC Protected Fish Species and Habitat & Ecosystem Subcommittees. In addition, RWSC and ROSA Directors and staff meet monthly to share progress and build on opportunities to align work.\nWho are “RWSC participants” or “RWSC partners”?\nThese phrases are RWSC’s way of being as inclusive as possible in all of its work. Anyone who would like to participate in offshore wind and wildlife science discussions or work more closely with RWSC is invited to do so via public Subcommittee meetings, or by contacting RWSC staff directly.\nHow far offshore is the RWSC study area?\nThe entities that collaboratively lead RWSC have jurisdiction within the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). However, RWSC recognizes that species and ecosystems are not limited by political boundaries. To accommodate this fact, the ecological focus of the Science Plan includes all habitats occupied by the species under study. This could require collaboration with entities outside of the U.S. at times.\nHow is RWSC going to implement the Science Plan?\nThe new Executive Summary of the Science Plan recommends actions that the four sectors can take to implement the Science Plan. It is likely that Science Plan recommendations will be funded by a combination of individual entities that collaborate via RWSC and by funding provided to RWSC specifically for Science Plan implementation. Funds provided to RWSC may be pooled from several individual sources. For funds provided to RWSC, funding decisions will reside with the Steering Committee, informed by the expert Subcommittees and Science Plan, considering any limitations on the use of funds, and funders’ priorities.\nWhen will the Science Plan be updated?\nThe RWSC Steering Committee will evaluate the Science Plan in five years (i.e., at the end of 2028) to determine whether it needs to be updated. At that time, the Steering Committee will likely request input from each Subcommittee and RWSC participants on whether updates to each chapter and/or the whole Plan are needed. The Steering Committee will then develop a work plan to accomplish any needed updates that specifies a process and timeline over which updates will be completed."

    "section": "D.2 Focal Marine mammal species and recent trends in the RWSC study area",
    "text": "D.2 Focal Marine mammal species and recent trends in the RWSC study area\nMarine mammals include baleen whales and toothed whales (together, cetaceans), seals (pinnipeds), and manatees (sirenians). Distributions of marine mammals have been shifting in response to changes in their environment, including human activities, climate change, and conservation measures. For a current list of marine mammal species and their status in the RWSC study area, visit the NOAA Fisheries Species Directory at https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/species-directory/ and apply filters for “New England/Mid-Atlantic” and “Southeast”.\nAll marine mammal species are protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) which prohibits intentional or incidental killing, injuring, or harassment of marine mammals and specifies the circumstances and rules under which permits may be issued for such activities. Under the MMPA, NOAA Fisheries has developed stock assessment reports for all marine mammals in U.S. waters since 1994. These reports contain estimates of current species population sizes and population trends. Six marine mammal species are also listed as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), which prohibits “take” of these species and requires conservation of their habitat. In addition to stock assessment reports, NOAA Fisheries generates authoritative and up-to-date information on marine mammal status and trends via the following webpages:\n\nMarine Mammal Unusual Mortality Event\nNOAA Fisheries Protected Species Surveys\nMarine Mammal Health and Stranding Response Program \n\nEnvironmental Impact Statements (EISs) associated with the U.S. National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review of offshore wind projects provide detailed descriptions of the affected environment, impact analysis, and cumulative effects. Each proposed offshore wind project’s Final EIS should be considered an important reference for focal marine mammal species, recent trends, habitat considerations, and potential impacts. Final EISs are posted to BOEM’s website.\nFrom a regional and global perspective, natural and anthropogenic climate change are recognized as major drivers of changes in marine mammal distribution, and in some cases, abundance as well (Chavez-Rosales et al., 2022; Ganley et al., 2022; Meyer-Gutbrod et al., 2022; Pendelton et al., 2022; Thorne et al., 2022). Baleen whales’ prey in particular– which include zooplankton and small fish species–are susceptible to ocean warming and changes in ocean circulation. In response to climate-driven shifts in their prey, baleen whales have shifted foraging locations into places where fewer protections are available (Davies and Brillant, 2019), or where conflicts with more human uses are likely. NOAA’s 2023 State of the Ecosystem New England report (Lucey et al., 2023) describes the slow movement of several marine mammal species to the northeast and into generally deeper water (Chavez-Rosales et al., 2022) (and see figure below).\n\n\n\nFigure D.1: Direction and magnitude of core habitat shifts, represented by the length of the line of seasonal weighted centroid for species with more than 70 km difference between 2010 and 2017 (tip of arrow) [@chavez-rosales2022].\n\n\nThe following data products and tools provide relevant context to inform where new data collection is needed and which research questions are most urgent to address given present status and trends in marine mammal distribution, abundance, behavior as observed in the field or understood by the most recent analyses. These sources are updated frequently. Visit the links below for the latest data and information.\nHabitat-based Marine Mammal Density Models for the U.S. Atlantic:The Duke Marine Geospatial Ecology Laboratory leads an ongoing collaboration of federal, state, academic, and independent research organizations who pool scientific data and expertise to develop marine mammal species density models spanning the U.S. east coast and southeast Canada.\nPassive Acoustic Cetacean Map: This map shows when and where specific whale, dolphin, and other cetacean species were acoustically detected in the North Atlantic Ocean based on Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM). The dataset was compiled by the NOAA NEFSC Passive Acoustic Research Program using detection data collected by many collaborators.\nWhaleMap: Designed to communicate the latest whale survey results to scientific, regulatory, and industrial sectors to inform more effective, dynamic planning of research and conservation activities. The map is synchronized with data repositories from several different survey groups such that results are reported in near-real time.\nWhale Alert app: Launched in 2012 as a citizen science tool aimed at reducing the risk of vessel strikes. The free app uses whale presence data including verified sightings, acoustic detection from buoys and gliders, and aerial surveys to display a user-friendly map based on nautical charts from country-specific government agencies.\nRight Whale Seasonal Management Areas & Dynamic Management Areas (Slow Zones): Seasonal Management Areas (SMAs) for North Atlantic right whales are zones and times of year when all vessels 65 feet or longer must travel at 10 knots or less to reduce the threat of vessel collisions1. Dynamic Management Areas (DMAs) are triggered when groups of whales are sighted outside of active SMAs. NOAA Fisheries has proposed several modifications to North Atlantic right whale vessel speed regulations which will likely take effect in 2024. Please check NOAA’s website for updated information: https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/endangered-species-conservation/reducing-vessel-strikes-north-atlantic-right-whales#current-vessel-speed-restrictions.

For the most recent requirements, see the outreach guide for each location and gear type on the ALWTRP webpage. The complete plan is published in the Code of Federal Regulations (§ 229.32 Atlantic large whale take reduction plan regulations).\nBiologically Important Areas (BIAs) for Cetaceans within U.S. Waters: BIAs represent areas and times in which cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises) are known to concentrate for activities related to reproduction, feeding, and migration, as well as the known ranges of small and resident populations (NOAA CetSound, 2015). Updated descriptions and maps for U.S. East Coast BIAs are not yet available (as of October 2023) but will be incorporated by reference once they are published (Harrison et al., 2023).\nPrey and habitat data: Marine mammal prey species (e.g., zooplankton, forage fish) are driven by oceanographic factors and in turn drive mammal distribution, abundance, and behavior. Recent studies of hydrodynamic and oceanographic factors that are impacted by climate change and may also change due to the introduction of offshore wind structures summarize key issues and data gaps:\n\nPotential Hydrodynamic Impacts of Offshore Wind Energy on Nantucket Shoals Regional Ecology: An Evaluation from Wind to Whales (NASEM, 2023)\nOceanographic Effects of Offshore Wind Structures and Their Potential Impacts on the North Atlantic Right Whale and Their Prey (ACP, 2023a)\n\nSeveral sources of prey data exist across multiple groups:\n\nNOAA Fisheries EcoMon Plankton Data\nContinuous Plankton Recorder\nGulf of Maine MBON\nBOEM-funded zooplankton ecology study\nAtlantic Zone Monitoring Program (AZMP) Maritimes Region zooplankton (Canada)\nCenter for Coastal Studies\nNortheast U.S. Shelf LTER\nForage fish distribution models (Friedland et al., 2023)\n\nNorth Atlantic right whale status and trends:\n\nNorth Atlantic right whale Critical Habitat: The NOAA Fisheries Biological Source Document describes these habitat features in detail.

In addition, most marine mammal species are exposed to many other types of stressors in these areas. The cumulative effect of several stressors may create a biologically significant population level response (Kraus et al., 2019a).\nOf the large whale species that are of greatest concern listed in Table 1, baleen whales have typically been prioritized for attention with respect to offshore wind research (Southall et al., 2021a), due to their distribution and abundance in the study area, behavior, and life history characteristics that make them susceptible to some of the specific stressors potentially associated with offshore wind. That being said, the majority of studies describing the effects of construction and operation of windfarms on cetaceans come from Europe, where small odontocetes (dolphins and porpoise mainly) are the most common cetaceans. Avoidance and displacement effects, at ranges up to 10-26 km from the whole footprint of offshore windfarms during construction have been reported (Benhemma Le Gall et al., 2021; Brandt et al., 2018a, 2016; Dähne et al., 2017a, 2013; Graham et al., 2023, 2019). These studies indicate that the distance and duration of avoidance is related to received noise, which is further influenced by source level, sound propagation conditions, hearing range of the studied species, distance to the noise source, duration of exposure, level and type of mitigation and presence of other noise sources like construction vessels. There is variation among studies in the time reported for animal behavior to return to pre-construction levels, from hours (Dähne et al., 2017b) and days (Brandt et al., 2018b) to years (Teilmann and Carstensen, 2012), which also suggest that operation of offshore windfarms may also affect cetacean behavior. Tagging data from Europe around wind energy sites suggest that harbor and grey seals either habituate quickly or may take advantage of the wind farm physical structures as a foraging opportunity (Russell et al., 2016).\nKraus et al. 2019 summarized the potential short-term and long-term effects of offshore wind development on marine mammals and sea turtles in Massachusetts and Rhode Island Wind Energy Areas. The list of potential effects below from this report is relevant to the entire RWSC study area. Any concerns related to marine mammal species that are specific to each subregion will be further described in the following sections of this chapter.\nOverall, climate change increases the uncertainty surrounding marine mammal behavior, distribution and demography, which can abruptly and unexpectedly increases the risks associated with offshore wind development if marine mammals begin to use new areas and habitats or existing habitat more frequently or during different times of year.\nPotential short-term effects of offshore wind construction activities\nPotential short-term effects include noise from pile driving, vessel operating noise, and the increased vessel activity to/from and near turbine fields. These stressors could influence:\n\nDisplacement of marine mammals from wind energy areas\nIncreased risk of vessel strike\nDisruption to critical behaviors of marine mammals such as feeding, socializing, or nursing\nElevation of stress hormone levels in marine mammals\nChanges in vertical distribution, density, or patch structure of zooplankton and/or fish prey\n\nPotential long-term effects of offshore wind operation\nPotential long-term effects include wind turbine presence, and increased vessel activity to/from and near turbine fields. These stressors could influence:\n\nMarine mammal exclusion from or attraction to wind energy areas\nIncreased risk of vessel strike\nChanges to feeding opportunities\nEnhancements to marine productivity due to artificial reef effect around wind turbine foundations\nIncreased risk of entanglement from abandoned, lost, or otherwise discarded fishing gear attached to underwater offshore wind structures"

    "section": "D.3 Recommendations: Marine mammals and offshore wind in the U.S. Atlantic Ocean",
    "text": "D.3 Recommendations: Marine mammals and offshore wind in the U.S. Atlantic Ocean\nThis chapter builds on the research topics and questions related to marine mammals and offshore wind proposed by several groups over the last decade that should be addressed by a regional collaborative (Farmer et al., 2023; Kershaw et al., 2023; Kraus et al., 2019b; NJ RMI, 2021; Regional Synthesis Workgroup of the Environmental Technical Working Group, n.d.; Southall et al., 2021b). The RWSC Marine Mammal Subcommittee considered these previous bodies of work in developing the following list. In doing so, they have also highlighted the following concepts:\n\nFuture work will be aligned and coordinated with research needs and actions described in the NOAA Fisheries and BOEM Draft North Atlantic Right Whale Offshore Wind Strategy (NOAA Fisheries and BOEM, 2022).\nClimate change: Disentangling the impacts to marine mammals from climate change from any potential effects from offshore wind development will be a major challenge. For example, any attempt to establish a “baseline” representative of the past several decades must acknowledge that the environment changed rapidly over that time and continues to change rapidly. In addition, climate change increases the uncertainty surrounding marine mammal behavior, distribution and demography, which can abruptly and unexpectedly increases the risks associated with offshore wind development if marine mammals begin to use new areas and habitats or existing habitat more frequently or during different times of year.\nA key contribution of the RWSC Science Plan is the ability to look across all the various data collection activities and identify opportunities for synthesis.\nAssigning causality to observed changes may not be possible in all studies.\n\n\nD.3.1 Data Collection\nSeveral entities are requiring, funding, and/or advocating for marine mammal research and data collection activities with respect to offshore wind. The Subcommittee strongly recommends that funders ensure that all types of data are collected using consistent methods across locations and projects such that data can be used in other analyses and research, including broad scale analyses of potential impacts across many projects. Individuals and entities should consult with the Marine Mammal Subcommittee prior to collecting marine mammal data with respect to offshore wind to ensure that any new data collection does not duplicate existing efforts and is consistent with the tools and approaches already in use. Any individual or entity may join public Marine Mammal Subcommittee meetings by obtaining meeting links on the RWSC website.\nA combination of methods (visual, acoustic, tagging) is recommended to provide the most complete information and context to marine mammal observations, given the strengths and limitations of each method alone. For example, pairing passive acoustics with visual observations can provide more information about marine mammal behavior at the time vocalizations are recorded.\n\nVisual observations (ship-based, aerial, conventional imagery) are most robust during daylight hours and weather conditions with good visibility. However, these methods only capture marine mammals at or near the surface.\nThermal and infrared imagery increases the amount of time each day that marine mammals can be detected visually. Some of the technologies associated with imagery are being tested by offshore wind developers and other experts.\nPassive acoustics (real-time and archival) can be used to detect marine mammals during all hours of the day, all year long, and during most conditions (high levels of ambient noise could impact detection). However, acoustics tools only detect whales that are vocalizing.\nTagging methods are typically applied to understand fine-scale movement and behavior of individuals. Tags may be difficult to deploy but can provide useful information about an animal’s responses to oceanographic conditions or known stressors that are being measured simultaneously.\n\nBOEM requires various types of marine mammal data collection and monitoring as part of the approval process for each offshore wind project’s Construction and Operations Plans (COPs). These activities may include:\n\nVisual and passive acoustic monitoring of vessel transit corridors to/from the project site\nPassive acoustic monitoring and visual surveys before and during activities such as pile driving and geophysical surveys\nLong-term/archival passive acoustic monitoring to record ambient noise and marine mammal species before, during, and for a specified period of time after construction\n\nNOAA, BOEM, and several states are also funding the deployment of passive acoustic monitoring sensors in the RWSC study area. Deployment locations and data management are being coordinated through the RWSC Marine Mammal Subcommittee (visit https://rwsc.org/pam for the latest information). The recently completed Power analysis for optimal design of a passive acoustic monitoring network for US east coast offshore wind (Chudzinska and Thomas, 2023) highlighted several data gaps that if filled, would improve the ability to assess the statistical power of the regional passive acoustic monitoring network:\n\nImprove estimates of acoustic detection rates and cue rates of baleen whales during non-construction conditions.\nImprove dose-response curves by obtaining in-situ behavioral data at offshore wind construction sites on baleen whale responses to pile driving noise. This would require collecting a range of data types including PAM and visual observations (aerial or ship-based).\nExpand passive acoustic monitoring outside of wind energy areas, especially along the shelf break, including using gliders and real-time systems.\n\nAdditional recommendations for the implementation of a regional scale passive acoustic monitoring network include:\n\nCharacterize baseline ambient sound and sound/noise during all phases of development, leveraging the regional passive acoustic monitoring network.\nExpand passive acoustic monitoring outside of wind energy areas, especially along the shelf break, including using gliders and real-time systems.\nTo the extent practicable, ensure alignment between archival and real-time deployments. Ensure that whale detection from real-time systems can be folded into analyses and data products that also leverage archival detection.\nCouple aerial/visual monitoring with acoustic monitoring to address the issues above and better link the resulting observational datasets.\nCo-deploy acoustic telemetry receivers to build out a telemetry receiver network, and other sensors as practicable.\n\nThe Subcommittee recommends the following regional-scale data collection efforts:\n\n(Cross taxa) Leveraging BOEM and NOAA’s ongoing efforts, ensure that the required Protected Species Observer data collected by offshore wind companies during construction and operations via Pile Driving Monitoring Plans and Vessel Strike Avoidance Plans (and any other mitigation plans) follows a consistent reporting approach and is eventually submitted to a Master Protected Species Observer Sightings Database for use in marine mammal analyses and research.\nEnsure that other marine mammal and environmental data collection required by the agencies during installation (e.g., sound fields, visual monitoring, PAM, thermal/infrared camera systems) are collected using consistent methods such that data can be used in other analyses and research including broader scale analyses of potential impacts across many projects.\n(Cross-taxa) Continue regional scale protected species and habitat data collection activities through the Atlantic Marine Assessment Program for Protected Species (AMAPPS), Ecosystem Monitoring Survey; NOAA Fisheries North Atlantic Right Whale Aerial Surveys, NOAA Fisheries Marine Mammal and Sea Turtle Aerial Surveys, NOAA Fisheries Marine Mammal, Sea Turtle, and Seabird ship-based surveys; NOAA Fisheries Seal aerial abundance surveys. Advance the NOAA Fisheries and BOEM Survey Mitigation Strategy (Hare et al., 2022) to ensure that site-specific and regional scale studies are put in the context of population trends and ecosystem conditions.\n(Cross-taxa) Coordinate regular high-definition aerial surveys that cover multiple lease areas using the same tools and methods. This effort should leverage the considerable amount of high-definition aerial photography data collected during site assessment by multiple offshore wind developers, and the Southern New England megafauna aerial surveys that have occurred consistently since 2011.\nCollect marine mammal behavioral and health data through tagging and visual observations to determine how individuals interact with wind farm structures and whether changes to foraging, socializing, or reproduction are occurring.\nIn collaboration with NOAA Fisheries, continue and expand stranding data collection and analysis with respect to stranding and mortality data time series analysis for the U.S. Atlantic Ocean.\nMonitor entanglement with subsea structure of floating offshore wind structures and monitor secondary entanglement where derelict fishing gear/marine debris may attach to subsurface offshore wind structures.\nCoordinate with the Northeastern Regional Association of Coastal and Ocean Observing Systems (NERACOOS), Mid-Atlantic Regional Association of Coastal Ocean Observing Systems (MARACOOS), and Southeastern Coastal Ocean Observing Regional Association (SECOORA) to advance oceanographic and biological data collection and use in marine mammal research.\nLeverage existing ocean observing platforms or add new ocean observing assets for marine mammal monitoring.\nWork with the Habitat & Ecosystem Subcommittee to ensure that key oceanographic and habitat data are collected and available as data products for use in marine mammal studies and as model covariates.\nWork with the Habitat & Ecosystem Subcommittee to determine whether offshore wind structures alter hydrodynamics, stratification, and mixing, and/or prey distribution and abundance.\nContinue to collect data across the region that allows analysis and synthesis of prey fields. Develop a coordinated regional scale zooplankton monitoring and mapping effort that builds off of and links existing surveys and studies including EcoMon, Continuous Plankton Recorder, the Gulf of Maine MBON, BOEM-funded Zooplankton Ecology study, Canadian AZMP, Center for Coastal Studies, Northeast U.S. Shelf LTER, and projects conducted by Stony Brook University and Rutgers University to establish a broader ecosystem observing system, synthesize patterns, and identify trends and linkages across trophic levels.\n\nThere is a need to advance technologies that improve marine mammal detection during all phases of offshore wind development, and to ensure that the performance of new technologies is evaluated consistently (see Technology chapter recommendations): Chapter 10\n\nDevelop, evaluate performance, and apply existing and emerging technologies that enhance marine mammal detection, including thermal cameras, infrared cameras, passive acoustics systems, and systems that integrate multiple methods for use during construction and operational monitoring and mitigation. Test “smart” mitigation methods triggered by marine mammal presence as determined by these systems.\nAdvance quieting technologies meant to mitigate construction noise (pile driving, vessel traffic) and operational noise (vessel traffic, operational vibratory sound).\nDevelop and deploy safe long-duration satellite tagging telemetry technology for tracking high-resolution movements of marine mammals in and around offshore wind structures.\nImprove analysis of monitoring data through artificial intelligence, automated acoustic, and image processing, and near real-time data availability.\n(Cross taxa) Develop and test eDNA assays/surveys/sampling regimes to understand efficacy of use developing indices of occurrence/abundance, including testing the effect of carcasses in the environment on eDNA detection.\n\nView ongoing and planned data collection activities for marine mammals in each subregion of the RWSC study area in the RWSC Offshore Wind and Wildlife Research Database. Based on those activities, plans for new data collection should consider the following:\nThe Gulf of Maine has long represented important feeding grounds for baleen whales from late fall to early spring. A resident population of Harbor porpoise is present in the coastal/nearshore areas of the Gulf of Maine from July to September. Almost all of the Gulf of Maine subregion is critical habitat (Northeastern U.S. foraging area) for North Atlantic right whales. Given that offshore wind development areas are still being identified in this subregion, baseline data collection should seek to characterize fine scale spatial and temporal habitat use. Studies of impacts specific to floating offshore wind (e.g., secondary entanglement), including modeling, should be coordinated through the Subcommittee. Cape Cod Bay, as a historical whale aggregation location, could serve as a sentinel site or control site to monitor potential population-level impacts to whales.\nIn Southern New England, known whale foraging hotspots (e.g., Nantucket Shoals) should be monitored using multiple methods to understand potential changes in behavior and habitat use. Studies of hydrodynamics and physical oceanography at the turbine- and wind farm-scales should seek to disentangle climate change drivers from offshore wind development and understand any changes that may impact whale prey (ACP, 2023b).\nWhale and dolphin sightings in the NY/NJ Bight have increased recently and includes increases in juvenile humpback whales in coastal waters, likely due to an increase in their menhaden prey. These whales may be particularly vulnerable to vessel strike due to their behavior and high density and speed of vessels in nearshore waters of this region (Stepanuk et al., 2021). Studies of whale-prey relationships and potential displacement from offshore wind areas in this region should be tailored to this context and capture rapidly changing ecosystem conditions and existing human uses in this area.\nThe U.S. Central Atlantic includes small resident populations of bottlenose dolphins, and large whales occur here and in the U.S. Southeast Atlantic at relatively lower densities than the other subregions. Data collection strategies and studies should be designed with the lower expected densities in mind. Both regions are important migratory routes, and the U.S. Southeast Atlantic contains critical habitat for North Atlantic right whale calving. Pregnant and nursing North Atlantic right whales and their calves are particularly vulnerable to vessel strikes in the Southeast U.S. from November to April annually because of the shallow bathymetry, the whales’ tendency to float at or just below the surface, and their long residency times in Southeast U.S. waters (approximately 2 months) (Cusano et al., 2019; Gowan and Ortega-Ortiz, 2014; Krzystan AM et al., 2018a). Calving females and their calves may also be at greater risk of exposure to acoustic impacts because of their long residency times (Krzystan AM et al., 2018b). More information is needed about the ways that reproductively active female right whales respond (or do not respond) to physical structures, noise, and vessels in their environment before wind projects are implemented in the Southeast right whale calving habitat. Characterizations of marine mammal distribution, abundance, and movement should continue in these subregions using multiple methods as offshore wind planning and development advances.\n\n\nD.3.2 Data Analysis\nData analyses should inform where new data collection is needed, characterize oceanographic and habitat drivers of marine mammal distribution, abundance, and behavior, seek to assess whether offshore wind is causing any observed changes, and evaluate the efficacy of monitoring and mitigation strategies. The Subcommittee is especially interested in studies that seek to distinguish between climate change-driven shifts in marine mammal distribution, abundance, and behavior and changes that may be driven by offshore wind construction and operation. Related changes of interest include:\n\nWhether construction activities displace or attract marine mammals\nWhether offshore wind structures displace or attract marine mammals\nWhether marine mammal feeding is altered due to changes to hydrodynamics or prey distribution/abundances caused by offshore wind structures\n\nIndividuals and entities should consult with the Marine Mammal Subcommittee prior to conducting analyses of marine mammal data with respect to offshore wind to ensure that the study leverages all of the available data and contributes to addressing the key recommendations described below to the extent possible.\nIn particular, researchers are strongly encouraged to leverage extensive existing and long-term data sources. These include but are not limited to AMAPPS, NOAA Fisheries North Atlantic Right Whale Aerial Surveys, Southern New England Aerial Megafauna Surveys, long-term/archival PAM, as well as shorter-duration observational studies (aerial, boat-based, tagging) as foundational elements of any analysis.\nThe following types of analyses are recommended:\n\nConduct a synthetic baseline assessment of marine mammals over the past several decades to characterize pre-development levels of spatial and temporal variability in marine mammal distribution and abundance patterns, from which to measure and assess any potential changes after the onset of offshore wind construction and regional-scale operation activities. Integrate density modeling and/or visual survey data, passive acoustic monitoring data, tagging data, oceanography/habitat data, and climate data to characterize pre-development levels of spatial and temporal variability in marine mammal distribution and abundance patterns.\nContinue to update and improve marine mammal density models. Use outputs to understand drivers of marine mammal distribution and movement and to assess/detect change, displacement, and/or potential impacts. Periodically evaluate model performance and use validation and evaluation results to continually inform and advance model/framework development and applications.\n\nIntegrate the latest observational and environmental data every 2-3 years.\nIntegrate data from multiple additional methods (strandings, digital aerial surveys, passive acoustic data, tagging) and covariates (oceanographic and prey distribution). Apply results to inform research designs, determine baseline abundance/distribution estimates, best practices, etc.\nConsider how to structure future model “eras” to reflect offshore wind pre-construction and construction/operation.\nThe modeling framework should be scalable to individual projects and the whole region such that individual project-specific outputs could be pooled into regional-scale versions of the model.\n\nRepeat a power analysis to optimize the design of the long-term archival passive acoustic monitoring network every 3-5 years. Ensure that new monitoring assets and analysis results are accounted for and that existing or new hypotheses and questions can be addressed by the regional network.\nInform and evaluate the effectiveness of mitigation strategies meant to minimize impacts resulting from increases in vessel traffic (i.e., noise, collision, displacement) from construction and maintenance of offshore wind projects.\n\nDevelop or update existing vessel and marine mammal co-occurrence models with information from the offshore wind industry regarding vessel types and numbers. Validate models with AIS and effort-corrected whale sightings data.\nConduct studies to assess the effectiveness of mitigation strategies such as speed restrictions, establishment of traffic corridors, etc.\n\nModel and assess entanglement risks associated with floating offshore wind.\nBuild off Project WOW and apply lessons learned to studies in and around other lease areas outside Southern New England and NY/NJ Bight. Use Project WOW Frameworks to identify stressors, species, and geographic areas to conduct assessments of displacement, attraction, or other changes to wildlife abundance, distribution, behavior, and/or health.\nIntegrate multiple types of data (e.g., acoustic, visual, stable isotopes, bycatch estimates, vessel trip reports) to understand potential changes in marine mammal feeding behaviors.\nDetermine whether prey distribution, abundance and/or behavior is altered due to hydrodynamic changes caused by offshore wind structures and from EMF/cables (heat and electromagnetic field).\nScope studies of EMF and marine mammals. Include studies of whether animals can detect EMF, what the sensing capabilities are, and over what distance.\n\n\n\nD.3.3 Data Management\nUnderstanding marine mammal movement and behavior near offshore wind developments will require close coordination among researchers, state and federal agencies, and industry.  The Marine Mammal Subcommittee will work with individuals and entities who conduct marine mammals and offshore wind monitoring and research to ensure that data are collected and stored in consistent formats that allow comparisons and pooling across individual projects in the RWSC study area.  This standardization is intended to support regional-scale assessments and the development and maintenance of regional data products and tools (e.g., marine mammal density models).\nTo support these efforts, the Marine Mammal Subcommittee recommends: \n\nMaintenance of an up-to-date resource list of recommended repositories, data and metadata standards, guidance, and protocols for use by all data collectors.  The current recommended resources are detailed in the table below. \nDevelopment of standard language for inclusion in requests for proposals and funding agreements to encourage or require the use of recommended resources. \nEstablishment of data sharing frameworks to appropriately manage access to sensitive industry-collected datasets necessary for research (e.g., acoustic data, Protected Species Observer data).\nCollaboratively establish timelines for marine mammal detection data upload and dissemination, especially through public platforms and apps, e.g., WhaleAlert, WhaleMap.\n\nThe following table lists the repositories and standards that are recommended for use in marine mammal data collection and identifies data types for which no or limited data management capacity (i.e., standard repositories and guidance) currently exists.\nTable 2.

The plan is intended to reflect the research and data collection needs of RWSC’s four Sectors with input from the science community. The plan will provide a path forward to ensure appropriate data collection protocols and standards are in place to support scientific research; this document can also provide a framework that can aid RWSC participants in coordinating and aligning funding to carry out necessary scientific activities.\nThis plan benefits greatly from the contributions of RWSC Bird & Bat Subcommittee members; researchers, managers, and other practitioners who joined Subcommittee calls; and the many scientists who conducted research or developed reference materials referenced throughout this plan.\nFollowing this introduction, the first section of the chapter discusses the species of birds which occur within the RWSC Study Area. The species section is followed by a brief section summarizing primary sources of information about species’ distributions. The next section of this chapter discusses potential effects (negative or positive) of offshore wind development on bird species. The following section summarizes common field research methods for the study of birds, with a focus on the offshore environment. The subsequent section addresses the major research topics relevant to birds in the context of offshore wind development. The remainder of the chapter addresses recommended science actions of value to the four sectors that make up RWSC (state and federal agencies, eNGOs, and the offshore wind industry), in the context of recent, ongoing, and pending scientific activities relevant to recommended actions."

    "section": "E.2 Species",
    "text": "E.2 Species\nThis chapter addresses bird species (Class Aves) which could be at risk from offshore wind development occurring in the Northwest Atlantic within U.S. waters.  For the purposes of this plan, the geographic area of interest comprises the Atlantic Coast of the United States, extending from Maine’s northern border with Canada south to the Florida Keys, and from coastal areas extending 200 nm east into the ocean, including state waters (3 nm from shore) and federal waters of the Outer Continental Shelf (3-200 nm). This area is referred to in this plan as the RWSC Study Area. \nHundreds of bird species occur within this area.  At least 416 native species are regularly found in the 14 coastal states of the U.S. Atlantic Coast, based on state eBird lists, U.S. Atlantic Coast ranges in Birds of the World, and Information for Planning and Consultation (IPaC) identifications of birds using North Atlantic offshore areas.  Many of these bird species inhabit the RWSC Study Area throughout the year.  Others may occur in this area exclusively during the breeding or nonbreeding season, or utilize the Atlantic Flyway for migratory movements between Canada and the Caribbean, Central America, and South America (AFSI, 2015; Newton, 2007; USFWS, 2023a).\nA number of these species can be expected to experience impacts from offshore wind development, including collision fatalities, displacement, attraction, barrier effects associated with avoidance, and effects on abiotic habitat features and prey populations (SEER, 2022); indirect effects of offshore wind energy development, like climate change mitigation, can also be expected. While the focus of this plan is on offshore impacts of offshore wind development, potential onshore impacts of offshore wind on bird species are also possible. For example, excavation efforts where transmission cables are coming ashore from offshore facilities could affect beach-nesting birds. Therefore, bird species which primarily or solely occur in the onshore environment along the U.S. Atlantic Coast are also included within the scope of this plan, although they are not the focus of the bulk of this chapter.\nAll 416 species that occur in the RWSC Study Area are included in RWSC’s Bird List, a spreadsheet intended to be updated regularly to provide a complete listing of and basic information about the current regulatory and conservation status of relevant bird species, as well as characteristics relevant to exposure and vulnerability to offshore wind impacts. Vagrants, rare visitors to U.S. Atlantic waters, and non-native species are not included in the list.\nFor additional summary information about the types of birds that occur in the RWSC Study Area, see RWSC’s Bird Descriptions by Category [forthcoming in 2024]. Bird “categories” are loosely based on taxonomy, but also incorporate considerations relevant to offshore wind. This resource provides basic information about categories of birds and their life histories as relevant to their exposure and potential vulnerability to offshore wind development.  These sections also address other conservation threats facing these species, which could be of interest in investigating potential impacts of offshore wind or offsetting its effects. Species at particular risk from offshore wind development due to their life histories or conservation status are highlighted.\nWithin this plan, some science recommendations are discussed within the context of five subregions of the RWSC Study Area: the Gulf of Maine, Southern New England, New York/New Jersey Bight, U.S. Central Atlantic, and U.S. Southeast Atlantic (see Chapter 1). Avian assemblages and ecology may vary considerably over this geographic area. The Gulf of Maine subregion, located at the northern edge of the Study Area, with deeper water depths and a complex coastal topography (many islands, peninsulas, and inlets), includes a suite of species adapted to colder waters and more northern climes. Several alcid species breed along the Maine coast but are not found breeding in other states; colonies of breeding Arctic Terns and Black Terns, likewise, are only found in Maine. At the opposite end of the Study Area, many birds of more tropical regions, like whistling-ducks, Limpkins, and American Flamingos, are only found in Florida.\n\nE.2.1 Regulatory Status\nMany bird species are protected via federal regulations.  Important and relevant federal laws include the following:\nEndangered Species Act (ESA).Currently 16 bird species that regularly occur in the RWSC Study Area are listed as Threatened or Endangered under the federal ESA (see RWSC Bird List), including two shorebird species (the Piping Plover, Red Knot) and three seabirds (Roseate Tern, Bermuda Petrel, Band-rumped Storm-petrel). In addition, the Black-capped Petrel has been proposed for listing as Threatened (USFWS, 2023b). The ESA places strict limits on the import, export, sale, possession, transportation, or “take” of listed species, with “take” defined as “to harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect, or to attempt to engage in any such conduct.” The ESA also allows for the designation of critical habitat for a species and prohibits the destruction of that habitat.\nMigratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA). Nearly all the birds that occur in the RWSC Study Area are afforded protection under the MBTA (see RWSC Bird List). The MBTA was enacted in 1918 to implement four international conservation treaties that the U.S. entered into with Canada, Mexico, Japan, and Russia (several of which were amended in more recent years). The MBTA covers over 1,000 bird species and is intended to ensure the sustainability of their populations. The MBTA prohibits the take (including killing, capturing, selling, trading, and transport) of protected migratory bird species without prior authorization by the USFWS. Of greatest relevance to offshore wind development is the prohibition of incidental take, that is the taking or killing of migratory birds that results from, but is not the purpose of, a lawful activity (USFWS, 2021). The USFWS prioritizes for enforcement incidental take that results from activities by a public- or private-sector entity that are otherwise legal and foreseeable, and occurs where known general or activity-specific beneficial practices were not implemented (USFWS, 2021). The USFWS is currently in a rulemaking process as the Service considers developing proposed regulations to authorize the incidental take of migratory birds (USFWS, 2023b).\nBald and Golden Eagle Protection Act (BGEPA).The BGEPA is more limited in scope than the two proceeding regulations. It protects Bald and Golden Eagles, both of which occur in the RWSC Study Area, prohibiting take of individuals, as well as their parts (e.g., feathers), nests, or eggs. The Act defines “take” as “pursue, shoot, shoot at, poison, wound, kill, capture, trap, collect, molest or disturb.” Regulations further define “disturb” as “to agitate or bother a bald or golden eagle to a degree that causes, or is likely to cause, based on the best scientific information available, 1) injury to an eagle, 2) a decrease in its productivity, by substantially interfering with normal breeding, feeding, or sheltering behavior, or 3) nest abandonment, by substantially interfering with normal breeding, feeding, or sheltering behavior” (50 CFR 22.6).\nIn addition to federal regulations, most states maintain a list of rare species which are afforded special protections under a state-level Endangered Species Act or other state statute. Over 150 bird species are protected by these state laws in the 14 states of the RWSC Study Area. Individual State Wildlife Action Plans also identify Species of Greatest Conservation Need (SGCN) which serve as foci for research and conservation efforts. At least two-thirds of U.S. Atlantic Coast birds are listed as SGCN in one or more states (see RWSC Bird List).\n\n\nE.2.2 Defining Focal Species\nWhile some scientific research methods will provide information about a variety of taxa (e.g., aerial surveys), other research methods (e.g., tagging) must by nature be species-specific. Since over 400 bird species occur regularly or occasionally in the 14 states of the U.S. Atlantic Coast, it is not practicable to study all these species using species-specific methods. For certain purposes, therefore, there is a need to identify birds which should serve as focal species for species-specific field research studies and other scientific activities.\nIn developing a framework to guide identification of focal species for these types of studies, the RWSC Bird & Bat Subcommittee began with criteria identified in a NYSERDA Stakeholder Workshop (Gulka and Williams, 2020). Through Subcommittee discussions, the list of criteria was slightly expanded to read as follows. Focal species could include:\n\nThreatened and endangered species (federal and/or state-listed)\nSpecies otherwise designated as of conservation concern (e.g., Species of Greatest Conservation Need [SGCN] in State Wildlife Action Plans, regional SGCN [Northeast and Southeast], state-listed “special concern” species, or proposed/candidate endangered species)\nOther federally regulated species (i.e., species protected under MBTA or BGEPA)\nSurrogates for rare species, which may be the best available proxy to study and understand rare species’ movements, behaviors, or expected effects of offshore wind development. (The Subcommittee recognizes that there are not perfect surrogates for the rare species themselves, but for some rare species, using a surrogate may be the best available option.)\nSpecies or taxa known or suspected of being sensitive to impacts from offshore wind development due to existing information and/or aspects of their life history which might render them susceptible to offshore wind. (Existing information could come from pilot studies in North America, or from longer-term studies in Europe, where more research has been conducted to date. Life history aspects that inform risk could include foraging strategy, flight height distributions, sensitivity to other anthropogenic disturbances, or overlap between areas of high densities for a species and Wind Energy Areas). Focusing on species for which significant impacts are anticipated can increase the likelihood of having the power to detect change in a given study or studies (NYSERDA ETWG, n.d.).\nWithin a taxon or guild anticipated to be sensitive to offshore wind, species with high levels of existing baseline data, and whose population parameters (e.g., productivity, survival) can more easily be measured.\nSpecies or taxa for which very little is known about potential impacts, because there has not yet been significant offshore development in their habitats (e.g., pelicans).\n\nAs noted previously, at least two-thirds of bird species that occur in the RWSC Study Area are listed as Species of Greatest Conservation Need in one or more states. This categorization therefore is not particularly helpful in developing a limited list of species for consideration as focal species. In addition, the category of “other federally regulated species” includes species protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. The regulation covers nearly all bird species in the RWSC Study Area, with the exception of some species in the Orders Gruiformes and Galliformes.  This protection is important from a regulatory and conservation standpoint, but it is not helpful in developing a priority list of focal species.\nGeography is important to consider when identifying focal species. Species distributions, abundance, and seasons of occurrence vary broadly across the five subregions of the RWSC Study Area. These differences are important to consider when identifying focal species for species-specific studies within a given subregion. If a particular marine bird or shorebird, for example, only breeds within one or two subregions, these areas will naturally be the focus for breeding season studies. In addition, it may be important to focus studies in certain subregions where a species of interest is most common and abundant, so as to obtain a sufficient sample size The state listing status of a species and associated level of conservation concern may also vary by state and is important to factor into decision-making.\nThis Science Plan recommends that the RWSC Bird & Bat Subcommittee develop and maintain a shared bird exposure/risk vulnerability matrix to aid in the periodic prioritization of focal species by geography, lease area, and research topic (see Section 6).\n\n\nE.2.3 Regional Coastal and Offshore Distribution Information\nThis section addresses sources of mapped bird distributions in coastal and offshore environments which span the entire RWSC Study Area region. The resources detailed below have been developed based on data drawn from many smaller-scale studies and incorporated into larger databases or (in the case of defining critical habitat) collated as part of regulatory review.\nIn addition to these sources, many individual organizations and researchers collect and analyze bird distribution data relevant to one or more species for use at a local, state, or subregional scale. For example, many states survey nesting birds (including shorebirds and marine birds) and some, like New York, maintain a Breeding Bird Atlas.  The USGS and Environment Canada maintain data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS), covering the continental U.S. and Canada. Some of this information is also captured in National Audubon efforts, including the Christmas Bird Count and Important Bird Areas.\nA compilation of all of these individual sources of bird distribution data is outside the scope of this Science Plan.  However, this plan includes recommendations to include all newly collected survey and tracking data in regional databases, as well as recommendations for further compilation of historic data into these databases (see Section 6).\n\nE.2.3.1 Marine Bird Distribution Maps\nOne of the most comprehensive analyses of marine bird distributions in the RWSC Study Area was conducted by Winship et al. (Winship et al., 2018). Over 30 years of survey data contained in the Northwest Atlantic Seabird Catalog database, along with Eastern Canada Seabirds at Sea data from Canadian Wildlife Service, were analyzed using spatial predictive modeling to derive seasonal maps of the spatial distributions of 47 marine bird species in U.S. Atlantic Outer Continental Shelf and adjacent waters from Florida to Maine. Model predictions are presented as seasonal maps of the relative density of each study species, indicating where they are anticipated to be more or less abundant.  The analysis was designed to provide relative density, and does not purport to estimate the actual number of individuals/density of a given species that would be expected in any specific location. The maps were reviewed by experts with experience and knowledge of marine birds in the study area and their comments were incorporated into the accompanying report.\nThrough funding from BOEM, these maps were updated by NCCOS between 2020-2023 . As an additional component of this project, predicted changes in oceanographic conditions were used to project changes in distribution of several marine bird species in the context of climate change.\n\n\nE.2.3.2 eBird Maps\neBird is a project of the Cornell Lab of Ornithology and collaborators which collects and analyzes information about bird sightings by expert and citizen scientists in terrestrial and marine environments. Birders enter when, where, and how they went birding, and then fill out a checklist of all the birds seen and heard. In some cases, data submitters may be following specific protocols, such as that of the International Shorebird Survey. The eBird Science team uses statistical models and machine learning to analyze patterns of abundance, distribution, and migratory movements. Raw eBird data are combined with high-resolution satellite imagery from NASA, NOAA, and USGS to estimate population trends and to predict distribution and abundance of bird species for every week of the year.\nBecause these data are often collected based on incidental observations and include limited offshore data, the marine bird distribution maps described above are considered of greater value for the marine birds included in that analysis than eBird maps. eBird data are nevertheless valuable for species not modeled in the maps described above. Additionally, they can provide valuable information about coastal distributions of marine birds, shorebirds, and other species.\n\n\nE.2.3.3 Tracking Data\nMotus and Movebank are two databases that house data collected from automated VHF tagging/tracking and other types of tagging/tracking respectively. These databases provide centralized locations for viewing tracking data from multiple studies, although summary products are fairly simplistic and comprehensive analyses of bird distributions are not available through these sites. They are described in more detail in Recommended Database Summaries.\n\n\nE.2.3.4 Identified Critical Habitat\nFor bird species listed as Threatened or Endangered under the federal Endangered Species Act, the USFWS is required to determine whether there are identifiable areas that meet the definition of “critical habitat” (USFWS, 2003). Critical habitat is defined as:\n\nSpecific areas within the geographical area occupied by the species at the time of listing that contain physical or biological features essential to conservation of the species and that may require special management considerations or protection; and\nSpecific areas outside the geographical area occupied by the species if the agency determines that the area itself is essential for conservation.\n\nThere are 16 bird species occurring along the U.S. Atlantic that are identified as Threatened or Endangered across some or all of their range. In addition, the Black-capped Petrel has been proposed for listing as Threatened. Of these species, most either do not have critical habitat defined, or identified habitats do not occur in coastal areas. Defined critical terrestrial habitats could be relevant to where cables come ashore to connect to grid infrastructure, but are not broadly relevant to offshore wind infrastructure development. Critical habitat for the five listed and one proposed shorebird and marine bird species that occur along the Atlantic Coast is summarized below:\n\nThe Atlantic Coast breeding population of Piping Plovers is considered Threatened. Critical habitat for the wintering population of Piping Plovers along the U.S. Atlantic Coast was designated in 2001 and updated in 2008 (USFWS, 2008).\nA new definition of critical habitat for the Threatened Red Knot was proposed in April 2023. The proposed revised definition includes coastal areas of Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida, which are described in detail here.\nThe northeastern breeding population of the Roseate Tern is considered Endangered; it occurs through much of the RWSC Study Area, from Maine south to South Carolina (breeding Maine to New York). The Caribbean breeding population, which is considered Threatened, occurs north into the Florida Keys. No critical habitat has been defined for this species.\nNo critical habitat has been defined for the Bermuda Petrel or Band-rumped Storm-Petrel, both of which nest outside of the RWSC Study Area.\nThe Black-capped Petrel has been proposed for Threatened status. No critical habitat has been defined for this species."

    "text": "E.3 Potential Effects of Offshore Wind on Birds\nOffshore wind development and operations could have positive, negative and/or mixed impacts on birds. Many of the hypotheses about how offshore wind development will affect North American bird species are drawn from research in Europe, where offshore wind facilities have been in place and under study for longer time periods. For a recent review of European avian offshore wind studies through 2019, see Fox and Petersen (Fox and Petersen, 2019). For a brief summary of anticipated impacts to North American birds, see Bird and Bat Interactions with Offshore Wind Farms (NREL and PNNL, 2022). This section briefly summarizes the range of potential effects of offshore wind development on birds. For an up-to-date list of recently published literature on this subject, search the Tethys Knowledge Base.\nOffshore wind farms could affect birds through a variety of mechanisms. Injuries or fatalities could occur directly through collisions with infrastructure, such as offshore wind turbine blades, towers, meteorological stations, electrical service platforms, or other facility infrastructure (Johnston et al., 2014), or via collisions with boats accessing offshore facilities as part of construction and operations activities.\nBirds could also be affected in less direct ways through changes in the local environment caused by the presence of offshore wind facilities. These impacts could occur via many mechanisms, including the physical presence of turbine infrastructure, increased lighting, changes in sound (including infrasound), changes in pressure, changes to local electromagnetic fields, effects on prey species, or effects on how humans use the area of the wind facility.  These changes in the local environment could lead birds to be attracted to or avoid offshore wind facility infrastructure at the macro-, meso-, or micro-scale (Dierschke et al., 2016). For example, phototaxis, the attraction of birds to lit structures (Adams et al., 2021), could attract birds to lighted offshore wind infrastructure or boats, increasing collision risk as well as changing movement patterns and distributions. Increased sound and infrasound could affect the hearing abilities of birds both above and below the water’s surface, with potential impacts on foraging, navigation, intraspecies communication, or predator avoidance (Anderson Hansen et al., 2020; Mooney et al., 2019; Patrick et al., 2021). Increased vessel traffic could increase anthropogenic disturbances of some bird species (Burger et al., 2019; Schwemmer et al., 2011).\nMacro- and meso-scale avoidance of offshore wind turbines could lead to habitat loss or degradation. Habitat displacement effects caused by offshore wind facilities have been observed in a variety of bird taxa, @dierschke2016. Habitat degradation could occur if birds are less comfortable foraging within a wind facility, foraging efficiency is lower near turbine infrastructure, and/or the presence of the turbines cause stress levels to be higher, reducing birds’ physiological condition. Habitat connectivity could also be reduced via avoidance, although connectivity impacts are more likely to be a concern when considered cumulatively at the scale of multiple wind facilities (Masden et al., 2009). Meanwhile, some species, such as cormorants, show attraction to turbine structures (Dierschke et al., 2016). Certain bird species may therefore benefit from increased roosting and foraging opportunities around turbines – although offshore wind facilities could also serve as ecological traps if attraction increases collision risk.\nOffshore wind facilities may alter inter-species interactions in ways that benefit or negatively impact birds. For example, the artificial reef effect might alter fish distributions, affect local fish populations, concentrate forage fish around turbine foundations, or otherwise alter the ecology of prey species (Degraer et al., 2020). Changes in the distribution patterns or abundance of forage fish could increase or decrease the forage quality of certain habitats, bring one bird species into greater proximity to a competitor for the same food sources, or concentrate animals in a way that increases risk of disease spread. Human interactions with birds might also change in the presence of offshore wind infrastructure – for example, if an artificial reef effect of turbine structures brought more recreational fishing into areas of high marine bird density, entanglement in fishing gear could become more frequent.\nThe above focuses on offshore effects of offshore wind. Of course, activities such as trenching for cables at coastal sites and construction of transmission corridors to connect offshore facilities with onshore grid infrastructure are land-based components of offshore wind development that could affect species that frequent shorelines and inland habitats. Clearing of transmission corridors and installation of transmission lines have consequences for birds, including the potential for habitat loss, degradation, or creation, depending on the species (Askins et al., 2012; Martin et al., 2022). Because transmission corridors are not novel development types in the United States, have been the subject of past research, are addressed by current environmental laws, and represent a small area of impact relative to the footprint of offshore wind facilities, they are not the focus of this section or this chapter. However, they represent a potential source of impact that certainly must be evaluated as part of the environmental review of any wind facility.\nOn a global scale, the development of offshore wind facilities could serve as a major component of the transition away from fossil fuel use, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating climate change (Barthelmie and Pryor, 2021). The mitigation of climate change is a major conservation action affecting many bird species, including those that breed or forage at high latitudes (Bateman et al., 2020). Because oil spills and other pollution-related impacts from fossil fuels are major stressors for many marine birds (Troisi et al., 2016), moving to a clean energy framework could also reduce direct impacts from fossil fuel use.\nOffshore wind development could indirectly benefit avian species if wind facility developers implement effective voluntary off-site mitigation efforts, conducted in such a way and to such an extent that they actually provide a net benefit to species’ populations. Off-site mitigation planning is discussed later in this chapter. In addition, a greater scientific interest and research focus on certain species in the context of offshore wind development might lead to a better scientific understanding that elucidates unrelated conservation issues and opportunities and ultimately better serves these species."

    "section": "E.4 Common Data Collection Methods and Approaches",
    "text": "E.4 Common Data Collection Methods and Approaches\nA wide variety of scientific methods are used for studying birds in coastal and offshore environments, which are summarized below. This section is intended to provide a brief description of different study methods, rather than a detailed assessment of the pros/cons and current state of development of each technology/methodology. For tracking of new technologies, see the Tethys database of monitoring technologies.\nNote that this brief review focuses on technologies or methods which can be used in the offshore environment or at coastal/island nesting sites of seabirds and shorebirds. There are many additional survey techniques and protocols used in the onshore environment. These are relevant to the study of terrestrial effects of offshore wind – such as effects of trenching for cables where they are brought ashore, or clearing of transmission corridors to connect offshore wind with onshore grid infrastructure – but for the sake of brevity and a focus on novel offshore issues, they are not addressed here.\n\nE.4.1 Observational Surveys\nAt-sea aerial surveys for seabirds were historically conducted using airplanes flying at roughly 60-200 m over the ocean surface, with live observers recording observations within a certain distance from the line of transect. In more recent years, some at-sea surveys have transitioned over to the use of aerial photos or videos, including high-definition photos or video, which can be conducted at a higher flight altitude. High-definition aerial photography has some advantages over live observers, including reduced bird disturbance due to the higher flight altitude, less effect of observer bias, and the availability of raw data for quality control and future re-analysis.  In addition, there is some evidence that aerial video can cover a larger area, provide greater spatial accuracy, lead to higher numbers of sightings, and more frequently identify birds to species (Žydelis et al., 2019). Of greatest importance to offshore wind studies is the higher flight altitude – conducting at-sea surveys at no more than 100 m over the ocean surface will not be possible at offshore wind facilities once turbines are installed. In order to be able to accurately compare before/after survey results in the vicinity of offshore wind facilities, high-definition aerial photography (still photos or video) are recommended for all offshore surveys of seabirds moving forward. \nCensusing birds at sea is the primary objective of this research method; however, flight height estimates can in some cases be gleaned from the data. In addition, with digital aerial photographs, or particularly video, it is sometimes possible to identify obvious behaviors, like foraging dives. However, even with video, recordings are only brief (e.g., 6-8 frames of a bird over 1 second), and therefore not particularly informative regarding behavior.\nBoat-based surveys can also be used to inventory/census bird species present at sea. At smaller spatial scales, they can be more cost-effective than aerial surveys. They can provide a higher level of accuracy in identifying species, age, and behavior of seabirds at sea (Camphuysen et al., 2004). As lease areas become larger and locations further offshore, aerial surveys may naturally become more cost-effective and more common. While all study methods have some biases, boat-based surveys tend not to be as good as aerial surveys for detecting some taxa – particularly seaducks and loons, which can be disturbed by boats (Camphuysen et al., 2004).\nBoat-based or stationary (e.g., turbine platform-based) observations using live observers can also be used to estimate flight height and collect behavioral data, such as documenting foraging behavior or responses to turbines.\nIn coastal areas and on islands, population surveys of colonial nesting seabirds, long-legged wading birds, or shorebirds are common. These surveys are sometimes aerial (Bakó et al., 2014) (using aerial still photographs or video), or may be ground-based, including surveys at nesting colonies to census the entire population at a particular site and, in some cases, to assess survival of marked individuals. At nesting sites, other observational studies may also be conducted, including nest monitoring to document nest productivity over time, behavioral studies, and observations of adults feeding young to document diet.\nIncidental observations can also provide useful information about species presence and behavior, particularly for those infrequently observed at sea. Citizen science can also be used to collect these types of data – eBird is one database that capitalizes on this type of data to generate useful information about timing and distributions of bird occurrence, although offshore data of this type are quite limited.\n\n\nE.4.2 Radar and Lidar\nRadar systems (RAdio Detection And Ranging) come in a range of types, sizes, frequencies, and modes of action, which affect the spatial and temporal scales of detection, resolution, and types of data collected. They detect birds by emitting pulses or continuous streams of radiowaves which are scattered from any object encountered, producing an “echo” in returned energy which is detected and interpreted by the radar equipment. They can be used to study a variety of aspects of avian ecology (Hüppop et al., 2019).\nNEXRAD (WSR-88D) towers are large, S-band, Doppler weather radar stations deployed across the United States to provide information on a broad set of weather conditions, including precipitation and wind speed (Diehl and Larkin, 2005). These radars have a lower resolution than some, but can detect flocks of birds, including migrants leaving stopover sites for high-altitude nocturnal flights in the spring and fall, trans-Gulf of Mexico movements, and broad- and narrow-front migrations. They have been used to identify stopover, passage, and roosting areas (Buler and Dawson, 2014; Chilson et al., 2019), as well as to study changes in total bird abundance (measured as biomass) and phenology over time (Chilson et al., 2019; Horton et al., 2020; Rosenberg et al., 2019). In addition, there are applications for behavioral ecology describing flight speed, direction, orientation, and altitude. NEXRAD coverage does extend offshore in some portions of Atlantic coast, but the radar beam typically samples altitudes above most bird migration in this region. BOEM is currently funding a study to create a database of terrestrial migrating birds moving to and from the offshore environment including through use of NEXRAD along the U.S. Atlantic Coast. Note that Canadian weather radars deployed in the maritime provinces could also provide data valuable for studies at the northern end of the RWSC Study Area.\nX-band radars use smaller antennae and have a smaller spatial range. They operate using a shorter wavelength, and hence have a higher target resolution. These radars also scan the atmosphere more regularly, increasing temporal resolution. Mobile X-band radar units can be deployed on coastal and island sites, boats, or offshore infrastructure to monitor for passage rates of commuting or migrating birds. They cannot identify animals to species, but can provide information about wingbeat frequency and body size, which can inform classification, as well as information about flight height, direction, and speed.\nMany ships are equipped with S-band or X-band radars (or both) to aid in navigation, with S-band systems providing longer-range data and better functioning in fog, and X-band radars, as noted above, providing greater precision. These “marine” radars can also be used to detect birds, with precise applications and data dependent on the type of system.\nThe use of portable radars for avian research offshore is currently being explored through a BOEM-funded study.\nLidar (Light Detection and Ranging) systems work by a similar mechanism, but use a different frequency on the electromagnetic spectrum. In this technology, a laser beam is emitted, which bounces back after it encounters an object. Lidar systems are more precise than radar, but operate over a shorter range, and are obstructed by fog or rain (Bilik, 2023). The use of this technology for measuring bird flight height is effective offshore and can be accurate to within 1 meter (Cook et al., 2018). Cook et al. (2018) provides recommendations on use, but uncertainties remain regarding Lidar capabilities for wildlife monitoring, particularly for detection of small-bodied birds (Sloan and Schultz, 2023).\n\n\nE.4.3 Acoustics\nAcoustic surveys using acoustic detectors (a combination of microphones and recording devices) to record calls of birds are becoming increasingly common (Pérez-Granados and Traba, 2021), although they remain more frequently used for bats. This method of monitoring can provide information about migration phenology, species composition, acoustic soundscapes for communication, and, in some cases, numbers of passing individuals. Acoustic surveys for birds in the offshore environment are most commonly used for night migrants (Hill and Hüppop, 2008), and typically use passive, stationary detectors configured to sample primarily in the audible frequency range (e.g. 1-12 kHz). Passive surveys offshore utilize stationary detectors deployed on ocean buoys, meteorological towers, offshore wind turbines, other offshore infrastructure (such as electrical service platforms [ESPs], also commonly referred to as offshore substations [OSSs]).\nAcoustic surveys are only effective when study animals are vocalizing. Ambient noise can interfere with detection of vocalizing animals and limit the distance over which calls will be recorded, an important factor to consider in deploying acoustic detectors on operating turbines.  Challenges also remain in differentiating among flight calls of different species (“Bioacoustics data analysis  a taxonomy, survey and open challenges,” 2020; Priyadarshani et al., 2018). However, software for the detection, classification, and analysis of field-collected audio files continues to be improved (Van Doren et al., n.d.a). Some new software can address suboptimal signal-noise ratios and evaluate areas of masking interference to speed and to refine analyses (Van Doren et al., 2023). The extent to which acoustic survey technologies can be counted upon to operate continuously in harsh offshore conditions also requires further evaluation.\n\n\nE.4.4 Banding, Tagging, and Tracking\nCapture-mark-recapture studies can be used to assess population size, evaluate survival, and study migratory movements of long-ranging birds. Bird banding is a very common practice for birds of all sizes, with banding information typically going to a central repository, the Bird Banding Laboratory (BBL). (Note that the BBL database cannot handle data on birds that are not fit with metal USGS bands, which includes most piping plovers on the Atlantic Coast. Those data are instead housed locally on project-level databases.)\nThere are a variety of different types of tags which can be attached to birds to gather information about their movements. Birds can be outfitted with geolocator tags, which measure daylight versus time, allowing for estimates of latitude and longitude, approximating bird positions. An advantage of these tags is that they are very lightweight. However, they have an accuracy range of only ± 200 km, and the animal must be recaptured in order to retrieve the data.\nGPS dataloggers receive information from a satellite system known as the Global Positioning System, which is maintained by the U.S. government (Smithsonian Institute, 2023). Wherever a GPS receiver has unobstructed line-of-sight to four or more GPS satellites, it can use the information transmitted by the satellites to calculate accurate time and location. GPS dataloggers are set to record data at regular intervals (rather than continuously) to generate a dotted movement track. In order to access the data, the animal must be recaptured and the tag recovered. Alternatively, GPS receivers can be paired with a transmitter that sends the data to a particular server, which can be a satellite system (for global coverage) or cellular phone system (where cell tower coverage is expected to be available). For these types of tags, the animal does not need to be recaptured; however, the use of a transmitter requires a larger battery, which means that they cannot be deployed on smaller bird species. Geofencing is the practice of creating a specific study area defined by a virtual perimeter; this methodology can allow for the collection of a higher frequency of recorded GPS data locations within wind facility boundaries.\nSatellite tags are also deployed on birds. Platform Transmitting Terminals (PTT) tags send periodic messages to a global satellite system called Argos, which is dedicated to ecological and environmental research (Smithsonian Institute, 2023). Argos Service satellites pick up and store signals, relaying them in real-time back to earth, where data are processed and delivered to researchers. As with GPS transmitters, battery size currently limits the size of bird on which these tags can be deployed. Spatial uncertainty of Argos data is 250 m to &gt;1500 m, and flight height data cannot be recorded; thus, these data are less accurate than GPS data.\nVHF (Very High Frequency) and UHF (Ultra High Frequency) radiotags transmit signals in the radio frequency range, which can be detected with a receiver. These types of tags are regularly deployed on birds. Historically, tags with different frequencies were deployed on animals within one research study to allow for easy identification of different individuals. The animals were then tracked, often via manual telemetry with a hand-held receiver. Manual tracking could be conducted on-foot, using a vehicle, boat, or aircraft. Study animals could also be tracked via a receiver attached to a stationary tower with antennae pointed in multiple directions, which could be automated to detect signals periodically or rotated manually by a researcher to detect a signal with an associated bearing. Manual telemetry is limited by the search effort available for finding and pinpointing the radio signal, and hence faces significant challenges in tracking animals that range over long distances.\nIn recent years, the development of the Motus Wildlife Tracking System has allowed for much more widespread use of coordinated automated radiotelemetry for tracking of wide-ranging and/or migrating birds. This system relies on coded radiotransmitters which all operate on one of two common frequencies, but which emit unique ID codes to identify different individuals. Signals from the tags are received by a network of automated radiotelemetry stations consisting of antennas, a receiver, a power source, memory storage, and sometimes data transmission infrastructure.  Telemetry stations can be deployed on land, on coastal locations, or on offshore infrastructure, including ocean buoys and offshore wind turbine platforms. Advantages of this system include that tags are small and stations deployed by one research group can detect passage of animals by other researchers operating in the same network, allowing for development of a widespread network with more likelihood of detecting wide-ranging study animals. This system also has the distinct advantage over manual telemetry that signals can be monitored for continuously. Motus system technology has limitations, including limited range of some telemetry stations (typically 15 km) and, in most cases, an ability to determine only general proximity or bearing from the station rather than precise location. Efforts to improve triangulation capabilities are underway (see Section 6). Offshore wind developers are including deployment and maintenance of Motus stations, as well as tag deployment, as part of Avian Monitoring Plans developed for review by BOEM and USFWS. Motus station deployment and research efforts in the U.S. Atlantic are coordinated through the Atlantic Offshore Motus Project.\n\n\nE.4.5 Bird-Turbine Interaction & Collision Detection Systems\nOn turbine platforms, turbine nacelles, or other offshore infrastructure, cameras can be used to record bird presence and behavior in the vicinity of turbines, which can inform when and where animals are present in portions of the rotor-swept zone and document bird interactions with turbines, including perching, roosting, attraction, micro-avoidance, lack of response, or collisions. Cameras differ in their mode of action, resolution, and the frequencies of electromagnetic radiation they use, from conventional cameras that operate in the visual range, to so-called “infrared” cameras that operate in the near infrared range, to so-called “thermal” cameras that operate in the far infrared range. Continuously operating cameras provides unique information about bird behavior in the vicinity of wind turbines. These systems can also be employed in conjunction with other sensors (e.g., acoustics, radar) to deliver additional information about behavior or collisions (see below). However, many of these systems are expensive at present and often only deployed at one or a few turbines in a study area. The field of view of a particular camera is often not sufficient to encompass the full rotor-swept zone, at least with sufficient granularity to identify birds throughout that zone. The extent to which these technologies can be counted upon to operate continuously in the harsh offshore environment is currently being evaluated.\nAt onshore wind facilities, carcass surveys are commonly used to document mortality and estimate fatality rates for a variety of bird species that collide with wind turbines. Offshore, carcasses of individuals can be expected to fall into the ocean in most instances and so collision detection systems are needed. Collision detections systems may incorporate visual range, thermal, or infrared cameras as described above (Happ et al., 2021), as well as acoustic detectors, radar systems, and/or accelerometers for impact detection. Over a dozen multi-sensor systems for documenting collisions and other bird interactions with wind turbines are under evaluation or currently in use at wind facilities (Dirksen, 2017; NREL and PNNL, 2022), and at least three have been deployed on offshore turbines (Lagerveld et al., 2020; Mark Desholm, 2003; Tjørnløv et al., 2023; Willmott et al., 2023). Efforts are currently underway at land-based wind facilities to develop, improve, and validate collision monitoring technologies. At present, validation activities are limited to the terrestrial environment, where results can be compared with carcass searches.\nThere are a number of technologies in various stages of development or deployment intended for automated real-time identification of bird species or groups. In addition to monitoring uses, these can be integrated with active curtailment or deterrent systems. Technologies that have been tested in the offshore environment include Spoor and DT Bird.\nBeach carcass surveys for the bodies of birds killed at offshore turbines have been proposed, but are only likely to be effective, if at all, in locations with very specific geographies and patterns of ocean currents. Occasionally, birds that collide with turbines may fall to the turbine platform. Birds may also collide with ships accessing wind energy facilities for construction or maintenance. Carcasses can be collected from turbine platforms, boats, and offshore infrastructure; when identified and documented, they provide incidental information about species’ occurrence in the marine environment, possible offshore wind facility impacts, and effects of increased vessel traffic in these areas.\n\n\nE.4.6 Other Monitoring Methodologies\nThere are a range of tissue sampling methods from live-caught birds, or their feces, which provide a variety of information about individuals’ migratory status, diet, and health, as well as population-level genetic structure.  These include collections of feathers, blood, skin, stomach contents, and fecal matter, to variously conduct stable isotope analysis, physiological analyses (e.g., for stress hormones), diet assays, genetic analyses, or others (Cook, 2012; Robuck et al., 2021; Steenweg et al., 2017).\nIn addition to direct sampling of individuals, collection of DNA from the ambient environment (eDNA) also has the potential to provide information about species present marine areas (Closek et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020). This is a relatively new technology and the utility of this technique to address various research questions is not yet fully understood."

    "section": "E.5 Research Topics: Birds and Offshore Wind in the U.S. Atlantic",
    "text": "E.5 Research Topics: Birds and Offshore Wind in the U.S. Atlantic\nResearch questions about offshore wind development and wildlife are centered around two common themes. First, there is a need to measure, estimate, model, or otherwise assess the scale of impacts of offshore wind development on birds, in order to determine which impacts are significant at an individual, subpopulation, or population scale. Second, there is a need to understand how to address any impacts that may occur via effective mitigation. In the context of this chapter, “mitigation” is used broadly, as defined by the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) regulations (40 CFR § 1508.20).  Thus, mitigation in this context includes:\n\nAvoiding the impact altogether by not taking a certain action or parts of an action. This could include strategies like siting wind facilities with setbacks from colonial breeding sites of birds of conservation concern or outside of areas with high densities of particular marine bird species.\nMinimizing impacts by limiting the degree or magnitude of the action and its implementation. This could include strategies like implementing lighting regimes that minimize bird attraction to turbines.\nRectifying the impact by repairing, rehabilitating, or restoring the affected environment. This could include projects like stabilizing or revegetating areas affected where trenching occurred to allow for laying of a transmission cable.\nReducing or eliminating the impact over time by preservation and maintenance operations during the life of the action.\nCompensating for the impact by replacing or providing substitute resources or environments. This could include off-site efforts like supporting predator control at a nesting site to increase populations of a breeding tern species that is affected by collision mortality.\n\nThe goal of mitigation measures could be to meet regulatory requirements to negate or offset any negative impacts of offshore wind development, or to meet voluntary goals of providing a net benefit to the species.\nFrom the perspective of a regulator, conservationist, or offshore wind developer, the progress of research would ideally proceed from development of accurate and cost-effective technologies for wildlife monitoring, standardized systems for data collection and analysis, and understanding of baseline conditions, moving then to evaluation of impacts and mitigation strategies, and finally to widespread development of offshore wind in the context of implementation of effective mitigation measures. However, given the rapid pace of offshore wind development (U. S. Department of Energy, 2023), this slow and measured progression is not a realistic timeline. Rather, multiple areas of research will need to be advanced simultaneously. In the meantime, regulators must necessarily rely on the best available science, both in identifying areas that should be avoided in siting of wind facilities (mitigation via avoidance) and in assessing potential risks to protected and vulnerable species. Tools must continue to be developed to help inform these efforts. While many conservationists prefer focusing on earlier steps in the mitigation hierarchy (Arlidge et al., 2018), the reality is that the impacts of offshore wind development will not be fully evaluated until many hundreds of turbines are installed. This suggests that effective on-site and off-site mitigation measures will also need to be an early focus, because once turbines are in the water, they are unlikely to be removed or turned off completely. On-site mitigation options may be employed, where feasible. However, off-site mitigation to compensate for or voluntarily offset impacts may be the only viable option, in some cases, for addressing documented or probable impacts.\nResearch topics of interest for birds and offshore wind include:\n\nCreating a structure in which to collaboratively conduct and share scientific research and advances, through discussion, coordination, and planning.\nImproving data collection and distribution methods.  This includes standardization of data workflows, refinement of structures for data sharing, and technological advances.\nUnderstanding baseline conditions of bird populations and bird ecology offshore. \n\nThis includes addressing questions about how distribution patterns, density, and movements vary by time of year, with meteorological conditions, across seasons (i.e., breeding, migration, nonbreeding seasons), by sex, age, and reproductive status, with interannual variation, and especially in the context of global climate change.  Understanding distribution and abundance during the breeding season is of particular interest for colonial nesters that may be tied to only a few historic breeding areas. Movement metrics of interest include speed, distance and longevity of flights, flight height, and starting points and destinations.\nThis also includes assessing important variables relative to population dynamics (e.g., fecundity, survival, population structure) and interactions among bird species and with prey populations.\n\nInforming pre-construction risk assessments of potential impacts to birds. This includes considering exposure of birds to offshore wind development, based on baseline distributions noted above. Collecting data to inform collision risk models and developing these models are also included.\nAssessing impacts of construction and operation of offshore wind facilities. This includes assessing changes from baseline conditions (e.g., distribution patterns, movements, population dynamics and trajectories, ecological interactions) in the context of climate change and other environmental changes. It also includes documenting collision fatalities, where possible.\nEvaluating on-site mitigation strategies. This could include mitigation activities effective during construction (e.g., noise reduction measures) or operation (e.g., painting turbine blades).\nIdentifying and evaluating off-site mitigation strategies. As noted above, due to the rapid pace of offshore wind development relative to the pace of research on impacts, off-site mitigation could represent an important aspect of offshore wind development, if significant impacts are found. These could be implemented to meet “no net loss” regulatory requirements or involve voluntary conservation offsets providing a net benefit to species.\n\nSpecific research questions are detailed in the Atlantic Offshore Wind Environmental Research Recommendations database, which summarizes data gaps and questions from a variety of peer-reviewed and technical report publications.\nOne recommendation of this plan is to reconcile broad research topics with specific research questions through the identification of focal species, major potential areas of offshore wind impact, and focal research questions by subregion and lease area (see Section 6)."

    "text": "E.6 Regional-scale Ongoing, Pending, and Recommended Science Actions in the U.S. Atlantic\nThis section of the Science Plan discusses science actions recommended to further the scientific understanding of effects of offshore wind infrastructure on birds and to address mitigation strategies in the context of identified impacts.\nThis section is structured by the type of science action, including:\n\nData management\n\nStandardization of data collection, analysis, and reporting\nHistorical data compilation\n\nData analysis & planning\n\nModel development and statistical frameworks\nMeta-analysis and literature review\nOptimizing research, monitoring, and mitigation\n\nTechnology advancement\nField data collection and analysis\n\nRecent, current, and pending science activities are discussed throughout as necessary to provide a context for current recommendations. These and other recent activities are tracked in the RWSC Offshore Wind & Wildlife Research Database.\nOther resources for learning about recent and on-going offshore wind-wildlife research include the Tethys Knowledge Base, a Pacific Northwest National Laboratory database, which houses publications, reports, and presentations relevant to offshore wind, and the Tethys Offshore Wind metadata, which compiles information on environmental monitoring conducted at offshore wind energy projects around the world. The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority Environmental Technical Working Group (NYSERDA E-TWG) hosts State of the Science Workshops on Wildlife and Offshore Wind Energy, which provide an opportunity for researchers to present and discuss updates on the state of knowledge regarding wildlife and offshore wind energy development and to promote collaboration and regional coordination. Both the E-TWG and Tethys have webinar libraries regarding environmental issues and offshore wind.\n\nE.6.1 Data Management: Data Collection, Processing, Housing, and Compilation\nThis section addresses data collection, processing, and housing for the types of data collected as part of studies to inform potential impacts of offshore wind development on bird species in the Northwest Atlantic. Section 6.1.1 summarizes recommended data standards and recommended science actions relevant to each data type. Section 6.1.2 provides detail on current and recent efforts related to recommended data standards and infrastructure. Section 6.1.3 provides detail on current gaps in data infrastructure.\n\nE.6.1.1 Data Standards & Recommended Science Actions\nUnderstanding avian behavior around offshore wind turbines, at the scale of entire wind facilities, and regionally along the Atlantic Flyway, will require close coordination among researchers, state and federal agencies, and industry. The Bird & Bat Subcommittee wishes to work with individuals and entities who collect data relevant to avian-offshore wind research to ensure that data are collected and stored in consistent formats that allow comparisons and pooling across individual projects in the RWSC Study Area. This standardization is intended to support regional-scale assessments and the development and maintenance of regional data products and tools (e.g., marine bird distribution models, collision risk models).\nIn order to support these efforts, the Bird & Bat Subcommittee recommends:\n\nMaintenance of an up-to-date resource list of recommended standard databases, data repositories, guidelines, and protocols for use by all data collectors.  The current recommended resources are detailed in the table below.\nDevelopment of standard language for inclusion in funding and contract documents to encourage or require the consistent use of recommended resources.\nEstablishment of an Avian Data Standards Working Group to address gaps in existing data infrastructure (detailed in the table below), including development of recommended protocols/standards where absent, recommendations for the structure/content of new databases, and identification of pilot study parameters where too little is currently known to provide specific methodological guidance. The order in which gaps are addressed will be prioritized by the Bird & Bat Subcommittee and working group members, taking care to avoid duplicating efforts by outside groups.\nEstablishment of data sharing frameworks to appropriately manage access to sensitive industry-collected datasets necessary for research (e.g., avian-turbine interaction, micro-avoidance, and collision data; turbine status and local environmental conditions; turbine specifications relevant to placement of monitoring equipment).\nCompilation of new and historic data into recommended databases to inform scientific understanding of behavior, distribution, and population dynamics of birds of the U.S. Atlantic Coast.\nReview of workflows to ensure processes are in place to facilitate transfer of data products from wildlife databases to appropriate regional data portals: Northeastern Regional Association of Coastal Ocean Observing Systems (NERACOOS), Mid-Atlantic Regional Association Coastal Ocean Observing

Northwest Atlantic Seabird Catalog. This effort represented a collaboration of BOEM, USGS, USFWS, and NOAA, with many researchers and organizations contributing data.  This enormous effort included development of the catalog in a format that allowed for flexibility to include and categorize different historic survey methodologies and practices. The catalog is open to collecting new or historical data sources as they become available, although a concerted effort to collect additional historical data in this category is no longer necessary. \nThe Avian Displacement Guidance Committee, a Working Group of the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority Environmental Technical Working Group (NYSERDA E-TWG), was organized to develop guidance for pre- and post-construction monitoring to detect macro- and meso-scale changes in avian distributions and habitat use in relation to offshore wind development.  In its draft guidance, this Workgroup identified key displacement and attraction-related questions, highlighted appropriate methodologies to address those questions, and provided specific study design and analytical recommendations for boat-based and aerial surveys. Final guidance is expected by the end of 2023.\n\n\nE.6.1.2.2 Tracking via Automated Telemetry\nAutomated telemetry data collected via the Motus Wildlife Tracking Network are automatically stored in the Motus system. Hence, historical data for birds are naturally stored alongside data collected from current and recent projects.  Birds Canada staff have made efforts in recent years to solicit tag metadata associated with tag deployments from past projects where not previously recorded in the Motus system.\nWhile Motus is well-established for use in terrestrial and coastal systems, it has only recently begun to expand into marine environments. With funding from NYSERDA, collaborators from USFWS, BRI, BC, and the University of Rhode Island (URI) developed a series of monitoring protocols, guidance, and tools to inform the deployment of automated radio telemetry technology in relation to offshore wind energy development in the U.S. Atlantic.  Final products, released to the public in 2023, include 1) a Guidance Document describing technical specifications for deploying and operating Motus stations on offshore structures, 2) metadata sheets, data sheets, and reference guides for use in the field, 3) a free, on-line Motus decision support tool known as “Informing the Design and Implementation of Offshore Motus Systems” (IDIOMS) that allows users to optimize site-specific Motus study designs at offshore wind energy facilities, 4) an Offshore Motus Data Framework, which establishes an Atlantic Offshore Wind Group within Motus and describes data workflows within Motus, and 5) a Monitoring Framework providing a comprehensive overview of using Motus to track wildlife offshore and to inform research, monitoring, and assessments of offshore wind energy projects in the Atlantic region of North America.\nDevelopment of the IDIOMS tool was informed by recent work on the optimization of Motus infrastructure conducted by Juliet Lamb of The Nature Conservancy. This effort included analysis and modelling of Motus tower layout and bird sampling strategies resulting in recommendations for appropriate tower layout and sampling of breeding shorebirds and seabirds to maximize Motus detections (Lamb et al., 2023).\n\n\nE.6.1.2.3 Tracking via other Tagging Systems\nUse of geolocators, satellite tags, and VHF tags on birds in coastal and offshore environments is a common practice, currently and historically. While some efforts have been made to organize tracking data in a central location, these efforts are by no means exhaustive. Review and analysis of these data would benefit from a focused effort to pull recent and historic data into Movebank. Movebank is a free, online platform hosted by the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior that allows researchers and wildlife managers worldwide to manage, share, analyze and archive animal tracking and other animal-borne sensor data.  The USFWS has developed basic guidance on metadata standards for non-Motus tagging efforts, but this is another area that could benefit from additional work to create more comprehensive guidance.\n\n\nE.6.1.2.4 Bird Banding\nAs noted in Section 4, banding information and band identifications are typically housed in a central repository, the Bird Banding Laboratory (BBL). The BBL database includes most banding data, but cannot handle data on birds that are not fit with metal USGS bands, which includes most piping plovers on the Atlantic Coast. Those data are instead housed locally on project-level databases.\nThe Bird & Bat Subcommittee is not aware of any recent data standardization projects by the BBL relevant to offshore wind and birds.\n\n\nE.6.1.2.5 Other Observational Data\neBird data document bird distribution, abundance, habitat use, and trends through checklist data collected within a simple, scientific framework. Birders enter when, where, and how they went birding, and then fill out a checklist of all the birds seen and heard. Specific protocols for some types of surveys are available. Given the availability of other databases, this database is recommended primarily for land-based surveys currently not accommodated by the Northwest Atlantic Seabird Catalog or the Coastal Waterbird Database.\n\n\n\nE.6.1.3 Current Gaps in Data Infrastructure\nThere are a number of identified gaps in infrastructure to support standardized data collection and workflows. The major gaps identified for birds are as follows:\n\nE.6.1.3.1 Coastal Waterbirds Data\nRegular monitoring of marine birds, shorebirds, and long-legged wading birds breeding along the Atlantic Coast is relevant to offshore wind development for a number of reasons.These types of data provide important metrics, including demographics, survivorship, fecundity, nest success, and population health. These data are useful in evaluating how offshore wind may be affecting populations. For example, lower juvenile survival could be associated with reduced foraging near wind facilities. These data are also needed to understand other longer-term trends or factors affecting populations, which may have nothing to do with wind development, but can help isolate the impacts of offshore wind through comparing regional to local data and recent to historic trends.\nFor colonial nesting seabirds (terns and skimmers, petrels and shearwaters, gulls, alcids, pelicans, cormorants, and anhingas) and long-legged wading birds (herons, egrets, ibises), in particular, breeding survey data can provide the locations of breeding colonies that are in close proximity to proposed or existing offshore wind facilities. These surveys can also help assess risk to adults and fledged young that may spend time in, around or pass through wind farms to forage or when traveling to and from wintering grounds. \nHistorically, many states individually collected breeding survey data for colonial nesting seabirds and long-legged wading birds, species groupings collectively referred to as colonial waterbirds (CWB). There have been occasional regionally coordinated CWB surveys conducted by two or more states simultaneously. However, historically, these data were stored in separate state-managed databases, since there was no central location for these data.  Some states’ data were eventually collated into a database managed by USGS Patuxent. This database was updated by collaborators from USGS, USFWS, and the University of Maine, who inventoried the data and created an ArcGIS Shiny App to explore and summarize these data at multiple spatial scales. The Maine Seabird Atlas, Seabird Colony Registry and Atlas for the Southeastern U.S. and other CWB survey data were also incorporated into the database at that time. In 2020, the Atlantic Flyway Council began funding the development of an Atlantic Flyway CWB data management system as part of the Avian Knowledge Network. This system is intended to securely house historic, contemporary, and future CWB breeding data collected by Atlantic Flyway states and provinces and provide mapping, analytical and other decision support tools to inform CWB management at multiple spatial scales. Some protocols exist for surveying particular species or groups of coastal waterbirds, as summarized in Section 6.1.1. However, in general, studies across multiple states do not use consistent and standardized protocols, in part due to difficulties in coordination and in part due to the wide variety of habitats and species assemblages occurring along the Atlantic Coast.\nIn recent years, the Atlantic Flyway Nongame Migratory Bird Technical Section led an effort to promote coordinated CWB breeding surveys within the Atlantic Flyway. The first flyway-wide survey started in 2023 and will finish in 2024. Because colonial waterbirds encompass many species that occupy a wide variety of habitat types, some of which are difficult to access, survey planners identified five focal species that states and provinces with limited capacity and/or funding constraints agreed to survey. The focal species include Common Terns, Least Terns, Black Skimmers, Laughing Gulls and Double-crested Cormorants; all species are either of high conservation or management concern in most Atlantic Flyway states and provinces. This pilot effort could serve as a template for future, regularly recurring coordinated surveys that cover increasing numbers of species, as states and provinces institutionalize CWB breeding surveys in their work plans.\n\n\nE.6.1.3.2 Marine Bird Diet Data\nMarine bird diet data provide important information associated with adult and fledgling survival, health, and forage fish availability.  One potential impact of offshore wind could be to change foraging patterns as well as forage fish abundance, distribution, and species composition – potentially having important ramifications for feeding marine birds and shorebirds. Collection of these historic data in a centralized database is a need that has been identified by other avian working groups; the data are relevant for many purposes, and not for an understanding of offshore wind impacts alone.\nMarine bird diet data (terns and alcids) collected by NAS and USFWS in Maine are all in an ACCESS database, but this has not been publicly shared and does not currently include data from other states or other projects. Recently, the Atlantic Marine Bird Cooperative (AMBC) forage fish and seabird colonies and adjacent waters working groups embarked on a coordinated seabird diet monitoring project along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. The initial focus will be on collecting fecal samples from Common Tern and Black Skimmer adults and chicks, using a consistent protocol.  Maine Coastal Islands NWR staff also initiated development of seabird diet monitoring guidance (L. Welch and R. Boettcher, personal communication). Other than these recent efforts, there are some older recommendations for reporting diet study results (Barrett et al., 2007), but the Bird & Bat Subcommittee is not aware of widely used marine bird diet data protocols.\n\n\nE.6.1.3.3 Collision & Bird-Turbine Interaction Database\nAs discussed in Section 4, some incidental collision fatalities may be identified during visits to offshore turbine platforms. Currently, there is no standard, cost-effective way to rigorously monitor for collisions offshore.  However, unimodal and multi-modal systems to document bird interactions with wind turbines, including behavior, micro-avoidance, and collisions, are being developed and validated at land-based wind facilities and pilot-tested on offshore turbines. Where fatalities are only documented in an incidental fashion, fatality data may be of limited value, but are nevertheless important, given our limited scientific understanding of potential offshore impacts. In the future, as technologies allow for collection of data in a more scientific and rigorous fashion, collision, micro-avoidance, and other turbine interaction data will be critical for evaluating impacts of offshore wind and (if necessary) identifying effective mitigation strategies. The need for a designated database and availability of detailed data for scientific analysis will hence become crucial.\nThere is some sensitivity regarding reporting of fatality and collision information, as well as sharing of videos and photographs of bird interactions with wind energy infrastructure. Reporting of these data is related to regulatory requirements under federal law, and public reporting of collision data could result in negative publicity. In addition, important covariates to use in analyses include potentially sensitive business information, like wind speed and the operational status of the turbine. Some wind companies consider these items to be proprietary information, although practices differ among companies and are dependent on company policies, permitting and development stage, and the granularity/specificity of the data provided. \nThere is no central database currently available for the collection of fatality information, or more generally for the disposition of video, photo, radar, acoustic, or impact detection data related to bird behavior, avoidance, and collisions associated with offshore wind infrastructure.  In the terrestrial environment, there are two databases which could inform development of an offshore database, Nature Counts and AWWIC. The Nature Counts database collects bird fatality information from Canadian land-based wind facilities. The American Wind Wildlife Information Center (AWWIC) collects post-construction fatality data from land-based wind facilities in the United States. Database managers work with wind industry collaborators to compile both publicly available and privately contributed fatality data, including important covariates (e.g., effort, methodology, meteorological conditions), and to allow for the analysis of this data by Renewable Energy Wildlife Institute (REWI) staff, as well as other researchers. Careful limitations on data sharing and requirements for sharing aggregated data ensure that no data from private sources could lead to identification of individual wind facilities.\nOne challenge associated with the AWWIC database is that it includes tailored non-disclosure agreements negotiated with each wind facility operator individually, and new data analyses and studies must often be negotiated with data contributors. An offshore collision fatality database for birds should instead include standard protocols for how data are collected, entered, and reported, including which covariates are necessary for interpretation. The database should also include clear data sharing standards to allow access for federal regulators and simplify sharing of data with outside researchers for analysis and synthesis, while addressing developer concerns regarding data security, confidentiality, and aggregation in reporting results publicly.\n\n\nE.6.1.3.4 Bird Acoustic Database\nAcoustic monitoring of birds is typically conducted for nocturnal migrants. It can be valuable in the offshore environment, where there is little information available about smaller bird species, particularly those moving at night. This methodology is of interest as a cost-efficient strategy to assess bird activities offshore (Normandeau Associates, Inc., 2014), and it is included as a part of some Avian Monitoring Plans. There is currently no centralized database to house such data or clear guidance on deployment.\n\n\nE.6.1.3.5 Radar and Lidar Data Results\nWhile NEXRAD and other large radar data are archived in government databases, there is currently no centralized database to house radar or lidar data results from smaller-scale systems. There are also no clear guidelines on appropriate systems for deployment offshore, deployment methodology, or specific study goals. As discussed in Section 4, radar and lidar can provide information about bird passage rates and flight heights.\n\n\nE.6.1.3.6 Tissue Sample Repository\nThere is an identified need for a tissue repository to store tissue samples, including carcasses of birds recovered from offshore wind facilities or boat strikes. These remnants are much less likely to be found at offshore facilities than at terrestrial facilities, since carcasses are most likely to fall into the ocean and not be recoverable and regular carcass searches are not likely to be proscribed. However, carcasses of birds may occasionally be recovered on offshore wind facility infrastructure incidentally. In addition, tissue samples may be collected from birds in offshore or coastal areas for various research purposes, including genetic, physiological, stable isotope, or disease dynamics studies. If not destructively sampled for analysis as part of the initial study, these samples could be stored for later use and to benefit future analyses.\nAt present, there is one repository which accepts bird carcasses recovered at renewable energy facilities. The Renewables-Wildlife Solutions Initiative (RWSI), organized by Todd Katzner (USGS) and Mark Davis (University of Illinois), has established a successful system for collecting and tracking bird samples from wind facilities, including sample storage and an Access database. The organizers are open to accepting samples and carcasses from offshore wind facilities. However, this small-scale repository could easily be overwhelmed if all bird carcasses and tissue samples currently collected or stored by state agencies, federal agencies, wind developers, and environmental consultants were to suddenly begun to be shipped to these locations.\nUSGS researchers, working with colleagues, have mapped out a hierarchical structure for a database that could allow for the tracking of carcasses and tissue subsamples throughout the country. There has also been discussion of logistical needs – for example, the establishment of regional collection centers to reduce transportation/shipping challenges for frozen samples. As of 2023, this plan has not been implemented. While development of a tissue sample repository would be of great value to renewable energy-wildlife research, it is likely of lower priority for offshore wind facilities where, as noted, collection of carcasses and tissue samples is likely to occur less frequently.\n\n\nE.6.1.3.7 Raw File Data Repository\nIn addition to databases, there is a need for a data repository to store raw data with large file types – e.g., radar data, thermal video, digital aerial survey photos and videos, and acoustic files. Derived data from these types of files should be made available in relational databases as relevant; however, the raw data should also be retained in a central location for quality control, re-analysis, and future re-evaluations with better tools. For example, future machine learning advances may allow for faster and more effective automated identification of bird species.\n\n\n\n\nE.6.2 Data Analysis & Planning\nData analyses and summaries should 1) inform where new data collection is needed, 2) characterize avian distribution patterns, density, movements, behavior, and population dynamics, 3) assess whether offshore wind is causing any observed changes, 4) assess the impacts of those changes on bird populations, and/or 5) evaluate the efficacy of monitoring or mitigation strategies.\nSection 6.2.1 summarizes recommended science actions.  Section 6.2.2 provides context for recommended actions in the form of current and recent activities. These sections are structured based on the broad research topics laid out in Section 5. Note that improvements to data collection and distribution methods are also addressed in Sections 6.1 and 6.3.\n\nE.6.2.1 Recommended Science Actions\nIn order to address current needs, the Bird & Bat Subcommittee recommends:\n\nCoordinating and planning for scientific research\n\nUsing best available information to build, maintain, and regularly update a shared exposure/risk vulnerability matrix for both marine and land-based bird species.  This matrix will be used to identify focal species by geography, lease area, potential impact of research interest, and research question.\nReview of available cumulative effects literature and adoption of a clear framework for assessing cumulative effects.\nConsultation with the Bird & Bat Subcommittee prior to conducting analyses of coastal and offshore avian data to ensure that the research leverages all available data and contributes to addressing key issues and data gaps.\nCollaborating among Subcommittees and with outside experts to ensure cross-taxa issues are being addressed.  Two examples:\n\nWorking with the Habitat & Ecosystem Subcommittee and fish experts to ensure that collected data and data products include important bird habitat variables and prey species. \nWorking with the Marine Mammal Subcommittee to coordinate with and train Protected Species Observers/Marine Mammal Observers to monitor and report dead and injured birds found on vessels.\n\nDeveloping a user-friendly guidance document on different bird research methods, summarizing the costs and benefits of each in terms of types and quality of data collected, effort required, financial costs, and options available.  (One guide that could be built upon is available here.)\n\nInforming pre-construction risk assessments\n\nIdentifying key metrics and summarizing relevant data (e.g., movement metrics, distribution and abundance, flight height, flight speed, micro-avoidance) to inform collision risk models.\n\nUnderstanding baseline conditions and assessing impacts\n\nRegularly updating marine bird distribution models and maps based on at-sea observations.\nAnalyzing existing tracking data from multiple sources to develop pre-construction baselines (e.g., movements, distributions, behavior) for focal species.\nIncorporating data from multiple methods (e.g., at-sea surveys, tracking, radar) and covariates (oceanographic, meteorological, prey distribution estimates) into integrated models.\nIdentifying key metrics and summarizing relevant data (e.g., movement metrics, distribution and abundance, flight height, flight speed, micro-avoidance, meso-avoidance) to inform vulnerability assessments and collision risk models.\nAnalyzing and summarizing available seabird diet data to inform potential effects of offshore wind energy on foraging.\nSummarizing available population demographic data to develop updated population models and assess potential population-level impacts for focal species.\nDeveloping regional-scale power analyses to inform regional-scale study designs.\n\nIdentifying and evaluating mitigation strategies\n\nAdvanced planning, development, and assessment of off-site conservation measures to provide compensatory mitigation (“no net loss”) or support voluntary conservation efforts.\n\n\n\n\nE.6.2.2 Current and Recent Efforts\n\nE.6.2.2.1 Coordination and Planning for Scientific Research\nSummary of Research Priorities. The NYSERDA E-TWG Regional Synthesis Workgroup was organized to inform and provide interim guidance for regional-scale research and monitoring of offshore wind energy and wildlife in the eastern United States. With technical support from BRI, the group compiled a database of research needs and data gaps from existing sources, including published, peer-reviewed synthesis papers, State of the Science Workgroups, federal and state agency efforts, and previous E-TWG Specialist Committees, etc.. The database was designed to synthesize existing data gaps and research needs so that researchers and funders can easily access, sort, and further prioritize topics. The database specifies focal taxa, spatial scale, and other information relating to each priority research topic. The Workgroup also drafted written guidance, including definitions of common terminology to support regional communications, general suggested criteria for prioritization of regional research topics, and general recommendations on study design and data transparency for regional-scale research efforts.\nData Gaps Analysis. Project WOW, a Wildlife and Offshore Wind study led by Duke University, with collaborators, is performing a data gaps analysis to understand where sufficient data exist to generate meaningful estimates of likely impacts, and where they do not. This analysis will be based on a quantitative scoring of literature, based on species names and taxa.  For a preliminary summary of this analysis, see Meeting 4 in the public RWSC files.\nCumulative Effects Framework. Croll et al. recently published a proposed framework for assessing and mitigating impacts of offshore wind development on marine birds (Croll and al., 2022).\nMotus Network Coordination. The Motus network continues to expand through the work of Birds Canada, USFWS, and many other collaborators. However, the system could benefit from a more coordinated and less piecemeal approach towards deployment of Motus stations, in an arrangement that maximizes detection probabilities for focal species. In addition, centralized calibration and maintenance efforts, to ensure stations are functioning and to measure detection ranges systematically, would also be of benefit for scientific rigor and cost savings. In summer 2020, USFWS organized initial meetings among stakeholders to discuss the value of coordinating and possibly centralizing calibration of Motus stations, as well as deployment of both Motus stations and VHF radiotags for automated telemetry in the offshore environment.  Phase 1 of the project would include efforts by RWSC to develop a plan for coordination and centralization, incorporating the Offshore Motus Framework, highlighting subregions/sites and species of interest, proposing a design or framework for optimal or strategic tag deployment, listing key participants (tag project funders, species and land managers, etc.), and describing data standardization practices.\n\n\nE.6.2.2.2 Understanding Baseline Conditions\nMarine Bird Distribution Maps. Through funding from BOEM, these maps were updated by NCCOS between 2020-2023 (Winship et al., 2023). As an additional component of this project, predicted changes in oceanographic conditions were used to project changes in distribution of several marine bird species in the context of climate change. The final report and maps should be available in late 2023 or early 2024 through BOEM and regional data portals.\nForage Fish and Marine Predators. Through NYSERDA funding, BRI used movement and survey data, spatial modelling, and forage fish modelling to examine ecological relationships between forage fish and their marine predators, including birds. The project utilized data collected by BRI, Normandeau, NOAA, and others to examine the extent to which abiotic environmental factors shape forage fish communities, what local conditions promote visible surface aggregations of forage fish, and associations between forage fish aggregations and abundance of marine predators along portions of the NW Atlantic seaboard. A brief summary of these efforts were provided in Meeting 10 of the RWSC Bird & Bat Subcommittee. Peer-reviewed scientific publications are available or soon to be forthcoming:\n\n(Goetsch et al., 2022)\n(Gulka et al., 2023)\n(forthcoming) New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA).\n\n“Multi-scale relationships between marine predators and prey,” NYSERDA Report Number xx-yy. Prepared by Biodiversity Research Institute. https://www.nyserda.ny.gov/About/Publications\n\n\n\n\nE.6.2.2.3 Informing Pre-Construction Risk Assessments\nVulnerability Assessments for North Atlantic Seabirds:  Collision and Displacement. Robinson Wilmott et al. prepared a report for BOEM in 2013 assessing the vulnerability to and risk of collision and displacement for seabirds of the Atlantic OCS (Robinson Willmott et al., 2013). Subsequent studies have examined collision and displacement vulnerability on the Pacific Coast (Kelsey et al., 2018) or modelled collision risk for individual species. However, no comprehensive review of collision risk has been conducted for U.S. Atlantic waters in the last decade.\nNormandeau recently finished a report on bird activity in the rotor-swept zone at two CVOW turbines which may inform/improve collision risk models. Three seasonal surveys were conducted, looking at micro-avoidance. The draft report will be available in a few months, after BOEM and the client have reviewed its contents.\nOn behalf of the NYSERDA E-TWG Avian Displacement Guidance Committee in 2023, Juliet Lamb conducted a literature review of studies related to bird displacement, avoidance, and/or attraction to offshore wind facilities. The review included publications from Europe (where most of the existing literature comes from) as well as the U.S. A manuscript for publication in a peer-reviewed journal is in preparation. See Appendix C of the Committee’s draft guidance for summary results.\nCollision Risk Model Development. USFWS, BRI, and URI recently completed development of a user-friendly collision risk model that can inform risk assessments of offshore wind development to listed and rare shorebird species. The model is known as “SCRAM” and made available as an R Shiny web application. The collaboration is continuing to improve functionality of the application, update features (including species-specific algorithms for Red Knot), and start a cross-Atlantic group on collision risk models .\n\n\nE.6.2.2.4 Assessing Impacts of Offshore Wind Facilities\nBAG Modelling. In addition to the data gaps analysis described above, in the later stages of Project WOW, BRI will be utilizing Bayesian spatial modelling framework to integrate before and after survey data to better understand displacement effects at offshore wind facilities, using extant data.\n\n\nE.6.2.2.5 Identifying and Evaluating Mitigation Strategies\nOff-Site Mitigation Options. The Atlantic Marine Bird Cooperative is an international group of resource managers, scientists, and other professionals with a specific focus and expertise in marine birds. Members include agency staff, non-governmental organizations, industry, and universities. The Marine Spatial Planning Working Group within the AMBC identified a need for advance planning regarding compensatory mitigation and voluntary conservation offsets. Specifically, the group realized that the scale and pace of deployment of offshore wind may not allow for a thorough understanding of potential negative impacts to birds prior to widespread offshore wind deployment, and that once turbines are in the water, they are unlikely to be removed. Where on-site mitigation is not sufficient, effective off-site mitigation measures must be identified and validated. The AMBC MSP has taken several steps to move this process forward. A presentation and dialogue were held at the most recent (2022) State of the Science Workshop on Wildlife and Offshore Wind Energy regarding needs for off-site mitigation planning. Most recently, a subset of Working Group members submitted letters to the USFWS and BOEM, detailing recommendations. These included developing a menu of research projects that include, as a deliverable, the metrics needed to calculate impacts/offsets and/or quantify birds grown/saved. Impacts should cover not only take from collision but also fitness consequences of displacement. USFWS and BOEM have now initiated this planning process.\n\n\n\n\nE.6.3 Technology Advancement\nTechnological advances can lead to more effective and more cost-efficient monitoring and mitigation strategies for birds in coastal and marine environments. Section 6.3.1 summarizes recommended science actions. Section 6.3.2 provides detail on current and recent efforts related to technological advancement.\n\nE.6.3.1 Recommended Science Actions\n\nTesting and validating bird collision detection systems (recognizing that initial validation may need to focus on land-based wind facilities, where carcass counts are possible).\nTesting and validating the efficacy of on-site mitigation strategies (e.g., lighting, painted blades), including evaluation in both land-based and offshore environments.\nTesting and validating the efficacy of off-site mitigation strategies or voluntary conservation offsets. (This is expected to take place only after the planning for and identification of appropriate options as described under Data Analysis.)\nImproving remote access to wildlife monitoring equipment on wind turbine platforms or other offshore infrastructure. This could include identifying workflows to allow for the transmission of wildlife monitoring data using existing wind facility fiber-optic networks.\nScoping and designing standardized spaces on offshore wind infrastructure to support wildlife monitoring equipment, including physical access, electrical power, data transfer capabilities, etc. This will require cross-sector and cross-taxa coordination.\nDesigning and improving automated methods to efficiently derive data from raw data files, such as deriving species identification and counts from digital aerial photographs, species identification within acoustic recordings, or tracking movement paths on radar and video recordings.\nDeveloping and improving tagging technologies to allow for lighter tags, longer-term tracking, measurement of additional parameters, or more precise measurement (e.g., of flight height).\n\n\n\nE.6.3.2 Current and Recent Efforts\n\nE.6.3.2.1 Research and Development (R&D) Needs for Wildlife Monitoring\nA recent study carried out by Advisian and BRI, through funding by the National Offshore Wind R&D Consortium, focused on identifying technology gaps for monitoring birds and marine mammals in relation to offshore wind farms, including the capabilities of available monitoring technologies to collect statistically robust data and to be integrated into typical offshore wind infrastructure and operations. The end goal of the project, which included assessment of existing systems as well as workshops with expert stakeholders, was to develop targeted recommendations for technology innovation where further tech development or coordination could improve the capabilities of monitoring to answer key research questions and better inform future mitigation and adaptive management of offshore wind development.\n\n\nE.6.3.2.2 Position Estimation within Motus\nAs part of Project WOW, collaborators will be working on Motus position estimation modelling, with the goal of developing a more accurate and effective method for estimating positions of tagged birds, based on signal strength and series of detections at one or more Motus towers/antennae.\n\n\nE.6.3.2.3 Bird-Turbine Interaction & Collision Detection Technologies\nAs detailed in Section 4, there are a multitude of systems to detect collisions and, in some cases, bird behavior around turbines, which incorporate some combination of cameras, acoustics, radar and/or impact detection systems.    These systems are in various stages of development, field-testing, and validation at land-based and/or offshore wind facilities.\n\n\nE.6.3.2.4 Artificial Intelligence for Species Identification\nUse of artificial intelligence to identify visual or acoustic detections of birds can significantly speed up processing time, reduce costs, and potentially increase accuracy for field-collected data. It can also allow for real-time identification of birds captured in video or acoustic recordings.\nUSFWS and USGS are working on development of AI software for use in identifying species detected in aerial surveys, including seabirds and waterfowl. Initial machine learning algorithm development has achieved the extraction of targets (individual birds and other wildlife) from imagery; current algorithm development is focused on classifying detected targets to the species level. This project has involved the development of an online feature annotation tool (based on the open-source annotation tool Computer Vision Annotation Tool - CVAT) for easy, streamlined labeling of training data by biologists and to serve as an imagery and annotation database for online data archiving and sharing.\nAuto-classification software for the identification of bird calls in acoustic data are also being developed and improved (Kahl et al., 2021; Van Doren et al., n.d.b).\nFor tracking of new technologies, see the Tethys database of monitoring technologies.\n\n\n\n\nE.6.4 Field Data Collection\nNumerous entities have active or planned field projects related to bird ecology in coastal and offshore ecosystems.\n\nE.6.4.1 Recommended Science Actions\nAs part of addressing near and long-term goals, and in the context of ongoing work, the Bird & Bat Subcommittee recommends the following field research, data interpretation, and technology advancement activities:\n\nUtilizing appropriate methods to further characterize movements, distributions, and abundance of wide-ranging bird species offshore, before and after construction.\n\nThe Bird & Bat Subcommittee will convene regularly to coordinate tagging/tracking efforts for species of interest in the context of offshore wind along the U.S. Atlantic Coast. Activities will include identifying general focal locations and focal species for tag deployment, exploring the potential to centralize tag deployment efforts, and coordinating deployment, calibration, and maintenance of Motus receiver network infrastructure.\nCoordinating and conducting regular digital aerial surveys that cover multiple lease areas and appropriate buffer zones using a standardized methodology. (As wind energy areas are leased and developed, aerial surveys covering individual lease areas plus appropriate buffers (see draft guidance) can be expected to survey portions of adjacent lease areas, so coordination could provide cost-efficiencies, as well as supporting standardized data products.)\nDeploying passive acoustic detectors at offshore wind facilities and on other offshore infrastructure to develop appropriate methodologies and monitor for nocturnal migrants.\nConducting targeted surveys along offshore transmission line corridors to explore potential effects on foraging and habitat use.\n\nContinuing standardized breeding bird surveys along coastlines and on islands to understand population dynamics, assess species distributions, and inform population models (see Data Analysis section).\nExpanding seabird diet and foraging studies to inform understanding of offshore wind facility effects. Conducting laboratory analyses of previously stored samples, as needed.\nEncouraging continued funding for long-term, standardized surveys, such as AMAPPS.\nDeploying multi-modal systems on turbines to assess bird interactions with wind turbine infrastructure (including micro-avoidance and collision risk). Combinations of acoustic detectors, radar systems, impact detection sensors, and/or visual, thermal, and infrared cameras are recommended to document bird behavior around wind turbines, detect impacts, and, to the extent possible, provide species-specific identification.\nIn addition to the methods detailed above, deployment of radar or lidar systems to document bird passage rates and flight heights is also recommended.\n\n\n\nE.6.4.2 Current and Recent Efforts\nBecause of the number of individual researchers and organizations conducting avian research in coastal and marine environments, as well as the rapid development of offshore wind energy and associated Avian Monitoring Plans, any summary of coastal and offshore avian field research would be incomplete and would quickly become dated. Instead, as noted above, readers are directed to the RWSC Offshore Wind & Wildlife Research Database for a compilation of recent, on-going, and pending projects. For projects not listed, researchers are strongly encouraged to submit a new entry for inclusion in the database. Planned research at offshore wind facilities, as outlined in Avian Monitoring Plans, is best tracked through Tethys Offshore Wind metadata.\n\n\n\n\nAdams, E.M., Gulka, J., Williams, K.A., 2021.

    "text": "F.1 Introduction\nThis chapter of the RWSC Science Plan addresses bat research and associated scientific needs in the context of offshore wind development. The plan is intended to reflect the research and data collection needs of RWSC’s four Sectors with input from the science community. The plan will provide a path forward to ensure appropriate data collection protocols and standards are in place to support scientific research; this document can also provide a framework that can aid RWSC participants in coordinating and aligning funding to carry out necessary scientific activities.\nThis plan benefits greatly from the contributions of RWSC Bird and Bat Subcommittee members; researchers, managers, and other practitioners who joined Subcommittee calls; and the many scientists who conducted research or developed reference materials cited throughout this plan.\nFollowing this introduction, the first section of the chapter discusses the geographic extent of the area considered within this chapter, the species of bats which occur within this geographic range, and a summary of primary sources of information about species’ distributions. The next section of this chapter discusses potential effects of offshore wind development on bat species. The following section summarizes common field research methods for the study of bats, with a focus on the offshore environment.  The subsequent section addresses the major research topics and questions relevant to bats in the context of offshore wind development. The remainder of the chapter addresses recommended science actions of value to the four sectors that make up RWSC (state and federal agencies, eNGOs, and the offshore wind industry), in the context of recent, ongoing, and pending scientific activities relevant to recommended actions."

    "section": "F.2 Species",
    "text": "F.2 Species\nThis chapter addresses bat (Class Mammalia, Order Chiroptera) species which could be at risk from offshore wind development occurring in the Northwest Atlantic within U.S. waters. For the purposes of this plan, the geographic area of interest comprises the Atlantic Coast of the United States, extending from Maine’s northern border with Canada south to the Florida Keys, and from coastal areas extending 200 nm east into the ocean, including state waters (3 nm from shore) and federal waters of the Outer Continental Shelf (3-200 nm). This area is referred to in this plan as the RWSC Study Area. While the focus of this plan is offshore impacts of offshore wind development, potential onshore impacts of offshore wind on bat species are also possible. For example, clearing of transmission line corridors could remove trees used by summer maternity colonies. Therefore, bat species which primarily or solely occur in the onshore environment along the Atlantic Coast are nevertheless included within the scope of this plan, although they are not the focus of this chapter.\n\nF.2.1 Bat Species occurring in the Northwest Atlantic\nThere are 17 species of bat which commonly or occasionally occur within the 14 states of the U.S. Atlantic Coast (Table 1). They are all insectivorous species that belong to the family Vespertilionidae. Three additional species, the velvety free-tailed bat (Molossus molossus), big free-tailed bat (Nyctinomops macrotis), and the Virginia big-eared bat (Corynorhinus townsendii virginianus), are either only rarely encountered in the RWSC Study Area or are only found inland and are not likely to interact with coastal or offshore activities related to offshore wind.\n\nTable 1.

In addition, the hoary bat has been added to the USFWS National Domestic Listing Workplan to undergo a status review at the discretion of the Service in FY2027 (USFWS, 2023). The ESA places strict limits on the import, export, sale, possession, transportation, or “take” of listed species, with “take” defined as “to harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect, or to attempt to engage in any such conduct.” (United States, 1983). The ESA also allows for the designation of critical habitat for a species and prohibits the destruction of that habitat.\nIn addition to federal regulations, most states have a state Endangered Species List, which offers its own protections.  Fourteen bat species are protected by state statutes in the 14 states of the RWSC Study Area.  Individual State Wildlife Action Plans also identify Species of Greatest Conservation Need (SGCN) which serve as foci for research and conservation efforts; all of the bat species that regularly occur along the Atlantic Coast are listed as SGCN in one or more states (USGS, 2023).\nHoary bats, silver-haired bats, and eastern red bats were designated as Endangered in 2023 by Canada’s Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) due to land-based wind energy impacts on these species (COSEWIC, 2023).\n\n\nF.2.1.2 Focal Species\nAt least six bat species have been detected visually or acoustically over the waters of the Northwest Atlantic (Solick and Newman, 2021). The vast majority of detections identified to species were one of the three long-distance migratory tree bats (eastern red bat, hoary bat, silver-haired bat). Tricolored bats, big brown bats, and Myotis species have also been detected, albeit more rarely (Solick and Newman, 2021). Challenges in differentiating amongst species acoustically (Nocera et al., 2019) means that it can be difficult to positively determine which Myotis spp. are detected offshore.\nWhile some scientific research methods will provide information about a variety of taxa (e.g., acoustic surveys), other research methods (e.g., tagging) provide species-specific data. In the offshore environment, the three long-distance migrants are the focal species of greatest interest for tagging efforts due to the greater likelihood of their exposure to offshore wind farms, as described above, as well as anticipated higher collision risk, based on fatalities at land-based wind farms (AWWI, 2020). Eastern red bats and hoary bats are of particular interest - eastern red bats because they are detected most frequently offshore, and hoary bats because they are the species considered at greatest risk from land-based wind development (AWWI, 2020; Friedenberg and Frick, 2021). Land-based wind fatalities would suggest these species are most at risk during the late summer-fall migration season (Lloyd et al., 2023), and offshore acoustic data support the idea that migratory bats are most common offshore during this season (Stantec, 2016). For Perimyotis subflavus and Myotis species of conservation concern (see Table 1), tagging of individuals occurring in coastal areas and on islands is also of interest, particularly during the late summer and early fall, when they may make longer-distance movements to hibernation sites, which could involve over-ocean travel. Spring migratory movements from hibernation sites could also involve over-ocean travel, although it could be more difficult to target for tagging individuals headed for coastal and island summer territories if captured at inland hibernation sites. Northern long-eared bats, little brown bats, and tricolored bats have been successfully captured at coastal and/or island locations (Dowling, 2018; Grider et al., 2016; Hoff, n.d.; Zara Dowling et al., 2017); if other listed Myotis species are captured, they could also be considered potential focal species. At present, there are not identified sites where other Myotis could be captured in numbers large enough to represent a meaningful sample size.\nOther species could be affected if near-shore facilities are built in the future, or by tree clearing and construction where transmission cables come ashore. In these circumstances, federally listed and state-listed species would be of greatest concern during the development process.\n\n\n\nF.2.2 Regional Coastal/Offshore Distribution Information\nPatterns of bat distribution and abundance in the offshore environment are poorly understood. Limited tagging/tracking efforts (Dowling, 2018; True et al., 2023) (T. Peterson, personal communication) and a number of mobile and stationary acoustic surveys have been conducted, in addition to documentation of incidental visual observations during aerial and boat-based surveys for other taxa (Hatch et al., 2013). Studies conducted through 2021 were summarized in a recent literature review (Solick and Newman, 2021), which provides a thorough compilation as well as links to the various studies included in the review. For more recent studies (since 2021), see the Tethys Knowledge Base and the RWSC Offshore Wind & Wildlife Research Database.\nThe North American Bat Monitoring Program (NABat) provides seasonal occupancy and abundance maps for a number of bat species across the U.S., modelled based on data collected by a host of federal researchers and other collaborators. Because the data are sparse, these maps do not yet include the offshore environment. However, the NABat grid system has been extended offshore, and the database is prepared to collect coastal and offshore detections of bat species, which can be incorporated into future analyses and mapping of species distributions (Cox et al., 2022).\nCritical habitat for ESA-listed bat species, where designated, typically focuses on important hibernation sites or large summer maternity colonies. These could be relevant to onshore locations of transmission infrastructure for interconnection between offshore facilities and the electricity grid. Critical habitat designations for bats are available as part of USFWS species profiles, as follows:\n\nIndiana bat: https://ecos.fws.gov/ecp/species/5949\nGray bat: https://ecos.fws.gov/ecp/species/6329\nNorthern long-eared bat: https://ecos.fws.gov/ecp/species/9045\nTricolored bat: https://ecos.fws.gov/ecp/species/10515\nFlorida bonneted bat: https://ecos.fws.gov/ecp/species/8630\nHoary bat: https://ecos.fws.gov/ecp/species/770\nLittle brown bat: https://ecos.fws.gov/ecp/species/9051"

    "section": "F.3 Potential Effects of Offshore Wind on Bats",
    "text": "F.3 Potential Effects of Offshore Wind on Bats\nCollision with operating wind turbines is expected to be the main potential impact of offshore wind development on bats (NREL and PNNL, 2022), although collision risk and fatality rates in the offshore environment are currently entirely unknown. In the terrestrial environment, bat mortality at wind facilities is a common occurrence (AWWI, 2020), and these fatalities are estimated to represent a population-level, and even existential, threat to some migratory tree bat species (Frick et al., 2017; Friedenberg and Frick, 2021). Analyses of onshore rates of fatality at land-based wind facilities has suggested that wind-associated mortality could also compound population-level impacts to bat populations already affected by white-nose syndrome (WNS) (Erickson et al., 2016).\nOverall, in the absence of offshore infrastructure, bat activity is thought to be lower at isolated offshore sites compared to most coastal, island, and inland habitats (Solick and Newman, 2021; Stantec, 2016). However, bats appear to be attracted to land-based wind turbines and other tall structures (Cryan et al., 2014; Guest et al., 2022; Jameson and Willis, 2014). Researchers have hypothesized that the greater height of offshore wind turbines and their prominence in an otherwise flat seascape could increase attraction of bats to offshore wind facilities (Solick and Newman, 2021), potentially increasing collision risk or leading to greater exposure to harsh weather conditions offshore (Wilson et al., 2023). Historic records indicate that bats sometimes flocked around sailing ships (Pelletier et al., 2013), and more recent studies have documented bats roosting and foraging around offshore turbines in Europe (Ahlén et al., 2009).\nGiven bat attraction to turbines, offshore wind facilities are not expected to cause habitat displacement or impose barriers to habitat connectivity. Offshore wind turbines in fact could offer potential roost and stopover sites or foraging locations for migrating bats (Ahlén et al., 2009; Brabant et al., 2020; Lagerveld et al., 2020), but due to collision risk, any energetic advantage conveyed by this increase in roosting habitat is likely more than offset by the potential negative impact of fatalities (Solick and Newman, 2021).\nAs noted above, the three migratory tree bats (hoary bat, eastern red bat, and silver-haired bat) have been found to be the most vulnerable to collisions at land-based wind facilities and are also the species that most commonly occur offshore. Therefore, these species are considered at the greatest risk of negative impacts. Little is known about the scale of potential impacts offshore on migratory tree bats or other bat species.\nPotential positive effects of offshore wind development on bats are difficult to evaluate at present. The expected effects of climate change on North American bats are largely unknown (Hammerson et al., 2017), and thus climate change mitigation effects of offshore wind development are difficult to assess. Much of the literature regarding effects of climate change on bats comes from modelling studies rather than empirical evidence (Festa et al., 2023). In the U.S., mitigation measures are typically designed to offset losses due to new infrastructure, rather than provide a net benefit to species. However, through off-site mitigation, offshore wind facility operators could voluntarily choose to support conservation actions that could potentially provide a net benefit to bat species. For rare Myotis species, off-site mitigation strategies include protection of hibernacula and summer maternity habitat (USFWS, 2022). Effective methods for off-site mitigation for migratory tree bats have not been demonstrated. One benefit of offshore wind development to bats could be the greater scientific interest and research focus on these under-studied organisms; this might lead to a better scientific understanding that ultimately better serves these species."

    "section": "F.4 Common Data Collection Methods and Approaches",
    "text": "F.4 Common Data Collection Methods and Approaches\nA number of scientific methods are used for studying bats in the offshore environment, which are summarized below.  This section is intended to provide a brief description of different study methods, rather than a detailed assessment of the pros/cons and current state of development of each technology/methodology. For tracking of new technologies, see the Tethys database of monitoring technologies.\nNote also that this brief review focuses on technologies or methods relevant to marine environments. There are additional survey techniques and protocols used in the terrestrial environment. Those are relevant to the study of terrestrial effects of offshore wind – such as effects of clearing transmission corridors to connect offshore wind with onshore grid infrastructure – but for the sake of brevity and a focus on novel offshore issues, they are not addressed here.\n\nF.4.1 Acoustic Surveys\nAcoustic surveys can be conducted using acoustic detectors to record calls of bats (Loeb et al., 2015). Surveys may be conducted using passive (stationary) methods or active methods. Active surveys onshore are typically conducted using a vehicle; at sea, they are often boat-based (Sjollema et al., 2014), although drones are beginning to be used experimentally (Workboat Staff, 2023). Passive surveys offshore utilize stationary detectors deployed on ocean buoys, meteorological towers, offshore wind turbines, other offshore infrastructure (such as electrical service platforms or “ESPs”); use of coastal and island sites are also common for understanding timing and locations of bat movements in the coastal and marine environments (Peterson et al., 2014). Acoustic surveys for bats utilize detectors which operate in the ultrasonic range in which most echolocation calls fall. Note that acoustic surveys are only effective when study animals are vocalizing, and ultrasound does not travel far through the atmosphere. Ambient noise can also interfere with detection of vocalizing animals and limit the distance over which calls will be recorded. Differentiating among species can also be difficult for certain taxa (Nocera et al., 2019).\n\n\nF.4.2 Tagging and Tracking\nTagging and tracking can be a useful way to understand bat movements and activity. VHF (Very High Frequency) and UHF (Ultra High Frequency) radiotags transmit signals in the radio frequency range, which can be detected with a receiver. These types of tags are regularly deployed on bats. Historically, tags with different frequencies were deployed on animals within one research study to allow for easy identification of different individuals. The animals were then tracked, often via manual telemetry with a hand-held receiver. Manual tracking could be conducted on foot, or using a vehicle or aircraft. Study animals could also be tracked via a receiver attached to a stationary tower with antennae pointed in multiple directions, which could be automated to detect signals periodically or rotated manually by a researcher to detect a signal with an associated bearing. Manual telemetry is limited by the search effort available for finding and pinpointing the radio signal, and hence faces significant challenges in tracking animals that range over long distances.\nIn recent years, the development of the Motus network has allowed for much more widespread use of coordinated automated radiotelemetry for tracking of wide-ranging and/or migrating bats. This system relies on coded radio transmitters which all operate on one of two common frequencies, but which emit unique ID codes to identify different individuals. Signals from the tags are received by a network of automated radiotelemetry stations consisting of antennas, a receiver, a power source, memory storage, and sometimes data transmission infrastructure. Telemetry stations can be deployed on land, on coastal locations, or on offshore infrastructure, including ocean buoys and offshore wind turbine platforms. Advantages of this system include that tags are small and stations deployed by one research group can detect passage of animals by other researchers operating in the same network, allowing for development of a widespread network with more likelihood of detecting wide-ranging study animals. This system also has the distinct advantage over manual telemetry that signals can be monitored for continuously. Motus system technology has limitations, including limited range of some telemetry stations (typically 15 km) and, in most cases, an ability to determine only general proximity or bearing from the station rather than precise location. Efforts to improve triangulation capabilities are underway. Offshore wind developers are including deployment and maintenance of Motus stations as part of wildlife monitoring plans developed for review by BOEM and USFWS. While these stations are being deployed primarily to support avian studies, they can also benefit bats. Motus stations in the U.S. Atlantic are coordinated through the Atlantic Offshore Motus Project.\nTag battery life and retention on the bat can be limited, reducing the length of time that individual bats are successfully tracked via this system.\nAt present, other types of tags, including geolocators, GPS dataloggers, and satellite tags are not regularly deployed on bats in the RWSC Study Area. Satellite tags are currently too heavy to be placed on the bat species that occur along the Atlantic Coast of the United States. GPS dataloggers are only practicable for species that regularly return to the same roost, where the animal can be recaptured. They have been used in studies of the Florida bonneted bat (Webb, 2018), one of the largest bats on the Atlantic Coast, but other species are not as large or not as predictable in roost location. Geolocators require exposure to daylight to function, which is not necessarily available in bat roosts.\n\n\nF.4.3 Banding and PIT Tags\nCapture-mark-recapture studies can be used to assess longevity and survival of bats. While bird banding is a very common practice for birds of all sizes, bat banding is less common. Banding of bats (on the forearm, rather than the leg) is carried out by some researchers, but there are concerns that this practice could result in injuries to the animal (Lobato-Bailón et al., 2023). The USFWS has convened a working group to study this issue in bats and come up with recommendations. PIT (passive integrated transponder) tags are also used on bats in some instances and have good retention rates (Van Harten et al., 2021). These tags are implanted into the animal using an injector. These types of identification systems are most useful in situations where an animal is expected to return to a given site where it may be easily captured, such as maternity colonies or hibernacula.\n\n\nF.4.4 Bat-Turbine Interaction & Collision Detection Systems\nOn turbine platforms, turbine nacelles, or other offshore infrastructure, cameras can be used to record bat presence and behavior in the vicinity of turbines, which can inform when and where animals are present in portions of the rotor-swept zone and document bat interactions with turbines, including roosting, attraction, micro-avoidance, lack of response, or collisions. Cameras differ in their mode of action, resolution, and the frequencies of electromagnetic radiation they use, from conventional cameras that operate in the visual range, to so-called “infrared” cameras that operate in the near infrared range, to so-called “thermal” cameras that operate in the far infrared range. The information provided by continuously operating cameras is unique and of great value to bat-offshore wind research. However, many of these systems are expensive at present and often only deployed at one or a few turbines in a study area. The field of view of a particular camera is often not sufficient to encompass the full rotor-swept zone. The extent to which these technologies can be counted upon to operate continuously in the harsh offshore environment is currently being evaluated.\nAt onshore wind facilities, carcass surveys are commonly used to document mortality and estimate fatality rates for a variety of bat species that collide with wind turbines. Offshore, carcasses of individuals can be expected to fall into the ocean in most instances and so collision detection systems are needed. Collision detection systems may incorporate visual range, thermal, or infrared cameras as described above (Happ et al., 2021), as well as acoustic detectors, radar systems, and/or accelerometers for impact detection. Over a dozen multi-sensor systems for documenting collisions and other bat interactions with wind turbines are under evaluation or currently in use at wind facilities (Dirksen, 2017; NREL and PNNL, 2022), and at least three have been deployed on offshore turbines (Lagerveld et al., 2020; Mark Desholm, 2003; Tjørnløv et al., 2023; Willmott et al., 2023). Efforts are currently underway at land-based wind facilities to develop, improve, and validate collision monitoring technologies. At present, validation activities are limited to the terrestrial environment, where results can be compared with carcass searches. The development of new and emerging technologies in this category can be tracked using the Wind Energy Monitoring and Mitigation Technologies Tool.\n\n\nF.4.5 Tissue Sampling\nThere are a range of tissue sampling methods from live-caught bats, or their feces, which provide a variety of information about individuals’ migratory status, diet, and health, as well as population-level genetic structure. These can include collections of blood, hair, wing membrane, and fecal matter, to variously conduct stable isotope analysis, physiological analyses, diet assays, detection of Pseudogymnoascus destructans (the fungus responsible for WNS), genetic analyses, or others.\n\n\nF.4.6 Incidental Observations\nIncidental observations can also provide useful information about species presence and behavior, particularly for bats, which are infrequently observed at sea. These observations have in some cases been collected via literature review (Pelletier et al., 2013). At-sea aerial and boat-based surveys for seabirds have in some cases recorded bat activity offshore on an incidental basis (Hatch et al., 2013)."

    "section": "F.5 Research Themes: Bats and Offshore Wind in the U.S. Atlantic",
    "text": "F.5 Research Themes: Bats and Offshore Wind in the U.S. Atlantic\nResearch needs for offshore wind development and bats are centered around two common themes. First, there is a need to measure, estimate, model, or otherwise assess the scale of impacts of offshore wind development on bats, in order to determine whether impacts are significant at a subpopulation or population scale. Second, there is a need to understand how to address any impacts that may occur via effective mitigation. In the context of this chapter, “mitigation” is used broadly, as defined by the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) regulations. Thus, mitigation in this context includes:\n\nAvoiding the impact altogether by not taking a certain action or parts of an action. This could include siting wind facilities in areas expected to have low bat activity (USFWS, 2012). However, post-construction mortality is not strongly correlated with pre-construction bat activity (Hein et al., 2013). If bat activity decreases with distance from the coast, siting turbines further from shore could be an avoidance strategy, but not enough is known at this time to determine where to site offshore wind facilities to reduce impacts to bats.\nMinimizing impacts. This could include curtailing wind turbine operations during periods of high bat activity (e.g., low wind speed nights) so as to reduce the risk of collision fatalities, a practice determined to be effective at land-based wind facilities (Adams et al., 2021; Whitby et al., 2021). Minimizing the impacts on-site could also include use of deterrent technologies, if deemed effective. These technologies continue to be developed and evaluated at land-based wind facilities (Hein and Straw, 2021). In some studies, individual technologies have reduced overall bat fatalities (Hein and Straw, 2021; Romano et al., 2019; Schirmacher, 2020; Weaver et al., 2020); however, no deterrent has shown consistent reductions in fatalities of eastern red bats, the most commonly detected species offshore (Solick and Newman, 2021).\nRectifying the impact by repairing, rehabilitating, or restoring the affected environment. For example, this could include placing artificial roosting habitats (Mering and Chambers, 2014) or creating snags in areas where maternity roost trees were cut to make way for a transmission corridor.\nReducing or eliminating the impact over time by preservation and maintenance operations during the life of the action.\nCompensating for the impact off-site. For example, this could include preserving foraging habitat, maternity roost sites, or hibernacula. As stated above, effective off-site compensatory mitigation techniques for migratory tree bat mortality have not been evaluated.\n\nThe goal of mitigation measures could be to meet regulatory requirements to negate or offset any negative impacts of offshore wind development, or to meet voluntary goals of providing a net benefit to the species.\nFrom the perspective of a regulator, conservationist, or offshore wind developer, the progress of research would ideally proceed from development of accurate and cost-effective technologies for wildlife monitoring, standardized systems for data collection and analysis, and understanding of baseline conditions, moving then to evaluation of impacts and mitigation strategies, and finally to widespread development of offshore wind in the context of implementation of effective mitigation measures. However, given the rapid pace of offshore wind development (U. S. Department of Energy, 2023), this slow and measured progression is not a realistic timeline. Rather, multiple areas of research will need to be advanced simultaneously. In the meantime, regulators must necessarily rely on the best available science in assessing potential risks to protected and vulnerable species. Tools must continue to be developed to help inform these efforts. While many conservationists prefer focusing on earlier steps in the mitigation hierarchy (Arlidge et al., 2018), such as avoidance, the reality is that the impacts of offshore wind development will not be fully evaluated until many hundreds of turbines are installed. This suggests that effective on-site and off-site mitigation measures will also need to be an early focus, because once turbines are in the water, they are unlikely to be removed or fully turned off. On-site mitigation may be the most viable strategy for conserving migratory tree bats.\nGiven this context, important science and research topics related to bats and offshore wind development include the following:\n\nDeveloping structures and methods to effectively and collaboratively conduct and share scientific research. This includes coordination, planning, collaboration, the standardization of data workflows, and development of improved data collection and dissemination methods.\nUnderstanding baseline conditions of bat occurrence, activity, and movements offshore. This includes assessing species occurrence and relative activity of bats over different areas of the ocean, with particular attention towards whether relative bat activity declines over a gradient from coastal to offshore areas. This also includes documenting characteristics of offshore flights, including timing (time of year, time of night), relationships to meteorological conditions, flight speed, and differences across species, sexes, or ages. These types of data have the potential to inform mitigation efforts. Because of the rapid pace of wind development compared to the pace of data collection, and because it is possible that attraction will lead bats to visit offshore lease areas more frequently once turbines are installed, near-term siting decisions are unlikely to be made based on collection of baseline data.\nDetermining if patterns of bat occurrence, activity, and movements change after construction of offshore wind facilities. This includes continuing surveys of bat occurrence and activity post-construction to understand if patterns change and continuing to document characteristics of offshore flights. Post-construction studies of this kind may help elucidate whether, and to what degree, attraction to turbines is occurring, and whether siting could be an effective mitigation strategy for future wind projects.\nAssessing collision risk at offshore facilities. Until validated and effective collision detection methods are widely available, proxies are necessary to assess collision risk. For bats, acoustic activity, particularly recorded at nacelle height in conjunction with information regarding turbine operational status, may be the best indicator of potential collision risk (Peterson et al., 2021). Assessing bat activity at turbine nacelle height relative to timing, meteorological conditions, turbine characteristics, turbine operational status, and species is an important research goal. (Tracking data may also provide information about movements of non-echolocating bats.) Turbine-mounted cameras and multi-sensor collision detection technologies may be able to provide actual measures of collision risk and fatalities. These data can help in understanding the relative risks to bat populations posed by collisions offshore as compared to fatalities at land-based wind facilities and other threats.\nDesigning and evaluating on-site minimization strategies. Assessments of the conditions associated with heightened collision risk (previous bullet) can inform design of efficient, “smart” curtailment strategies for bats, if these methods are deemed necessary to avoid population-level impacts to bats. If determined to be effective in the terrestrial environment, deterrents could also be tested offshore.\nEvaluating off-site compensatory mitigation strategies. If on-site mitigation measures are deemed insufficient or are cost-prohibitive, off-site mitigation measures could be considered.  However, these measures would need to be evaluated carefully to determine if they are realistic and adequate to address negative impacts.\n\nA database of specific research questions related to bats and offshore wind is available through the U.S. Atlantic Offshore Wind Environmental Research Recommendations Database."

This standardization is intended to support regional-scale assessments, data products, and tools (e.g., NABat occupancy and abundance estimates; evaluations of collision risk relative to wind facility, temporal, and environmental characteristics).\nIn order to support these efforts, the Bird & Bat Subcommittee recommends:\n\nMaintenance of an up-to-date resource list of recommended standard databases, data repositories, guidelines, and protocols for use by all data collectors.  The current recommended resources are detailed in the table below.\nDevelopment of standard language for inclusion in funding and contract documents to encourage or require the use of recommended resources.\nEstablishment of an Offshore Bat Working Group to address gaps in existing databases (detailed in the table below), including development of recommended protocols/standards where absent, suggestions for the structure/content of new databases, and identification of pilot study parameters where too little is currently known to provide specific methodological guidance. This Working Group has recently been established and, as a first step, will address methodological recommendations and pilot study parameters for passive acoustic detector deployment on offshore infrastructure.\nEstablishment of data sharing frameworks to appropriately manage access to sensitive industry-collected datasets necessary for research (e.g., acoustic data collected on offshore wind turbines, bat-turbine interactions, and collision data; associated turbine status and local meteorological conditions).\nIdentification, solicitation, and compilation of historic data into recommended databases to inform baseline understanding of bat distributions in coastal and offshore areas of the U.S. Atlantic Coast. In some cases, this may require re-formatting and QA/QC procedures to ensure species codes, units, and other metadata are entered consistently.\n\nThe following table lists the existing centralized or accepted repositories and standards that are recommended for use in bat data collection, as well as identifying data types for which no or limited data management capacity (i.e., standard repositories and guidance) currently exists.\n\n\n\nMethods and data types\nDatabase/Repository\nGuidance/Standards\nRecommendations\n\n\nAcoustic data (passive or active), including both records of identified species and raw acoustic files\nBat observations\n(colony and roost counts, capture records, incidental observations)\nNorth American Bat Monitoring Program (NABat)\n\nUtilize A Plan for the North American Bat Monitoring Program for survey protocols and field study guidance.\nVisit NABat Resources for detailed guidance on data preparation, processing, uploading, and QA/QC procedures.  NABat also provides a grid-based offshore sampling frame.\nDevelopment of offshore-specific protocols for passive and active acoustics are recommended.\nNABat has confirmed that it can incorporate contemporaneous local meteorological data and turbine operational status with bat acoustic detection data.\n\n\nDevelop offshore-specific protocols for passive and active acoustics.\nNABat has confirmed that it can incorporate contemporaneous local meteorological data and turbine operational status with bat acoustic detection data.\nSolicit historical acoustic data from coastal and offshore studies for incorporation into NABat.\nDetermine if Northwest Atlantic Seabird Catalog incidental observations of bats can be easily transferred to NABat.\n\n\n\nAutomated VHF/UHF tagging/tracking studies\nMotus Wildlife Tracking System\n\nUtilize Monitoring Protocols and Guidance for Automated Radio Telemetry Studies at Offshore Wind Farms for study design and data collection\nMotus Wildlife Tracking System resources provide extensive additional documentation on data collection, upload, and analysis\n\n\nImprove access to historical offshore bat Motus data through a systematic effort to reach out to relevant past projects and request public access to data if not already available.\nDevelop guidance regarding deployment, metadata, and data storage of local meteorological data associated with telemetry receiver stations to inform timing of bat movements and behavior relative to local weather conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther tagging/tracking studies\n(e.g., standard VHF, GPS dataloggers (if used))\nMovebank\n\nFollow interim USFWS Guidance for Coordination of Data from Avian Tracking Studies\nMovebank User Manual provides step-by-step guidance on adding, managing, sharing, and accessing tracking data\n\n\n\n\nCarcasses and tissue samples\nRenewables-Wildlife Solutions Initiative\n\nReport fatalities to USFWS\nContact the Renewables-Wildlife Solutions Initiative (RWSI) to submit samples\nNote that RWSI has limited capacity but is currently accepting samples.\n\n\nIdentify funding and develop additional capacity for carcass and tissue sample storage.\n\n\n\nObserved interactions with wind turbines, collisions, fatalities\n(e.g., via turbine-mounted cameras, impact detection systems)\nNo central repository\nNo identified standard protocols\n\nIdentify goals and pilot study recommendations for collision detection technologies.\nDevelop a database and standard data collection protocols.\n\n\n\nRadar/lidar studies\nNo central repository\nNo identified standard protocols\n\nIdentify goals and pilot study recommendations for radar/lidar studies.\nDevelop a database and standard data collection protocols.\n\n\n\nLarge raw file types (e.g., high-definition aerial photos, thermal video, raw acoustic files)\nNo central repository\n\n\nRetention of large, raw file types could allow for future QA/QC and re-evaluation with updated analysis or automated identification tools.\nDevelopment of a data repository, with standard protocols and data-handling procedures, is recommended as a cross-taxa action.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nF.6.1.2 Current Gaps in Database Infrastructure\nThere are a number of identified gaps in infrastructure to support standard data collection and workflows. The major gaps identified for bats are as follows:\n\nF.6.1.2.1 Collision & Bat-Turbine Interaction Database\nAs discussed in Section 4, some incidental collision fatalities may be identified during visits to offshore turbine platforms. Currently, there is no standard, cost-effective way to rigorously monitor for collisions offshore. However, unimodal and multi-modal systems to document bat interactions with wind turbines, including behavior, micro-avoidance, and collisions, are being developed and validated at land-based wind facilities and pilot-tested on offshore turbines. Where fatalities are only documented in an incidental fashion, fatality data may be of limited value, but are nevertheless important, given our limited scientific understanding of potential offshore impacts. As technologies allow for collection of data in a more scientific and rigorous fashion, collision, micro-avoidance, and other turbine interaction data will be critical for evaluating impacts of offshore wind and (if necessary) identifying effective mitigation strategies. The need for a designated database and availability of detailed data for scientific analysis will hence become crucial.\nThere is some sensitivity regarding reporting of fatality and collision information, as well as sharing of videos and photographs of bat interactions with wind energy infrastructure. Reporting of these data is related to regulatory requirements under federal law, and public reporting of collision data could result in negative publicity. In addition, important covariates to use in analyses include potentially sensitive business information, like wind speed and the operational status of the turbine. Some wind companies consider these items to be proprietary information, although practices differ among companies and are dependent on company policies, permitting and development stage, and the granularity/specificity of the data provided.\nBasic fatality information is reported to the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, but otherwise, no central scientific database is currently available for the collection of fatality information, or more generally for the disposition of video, photo, radar, acoustic, or impact detection data related to bat behavior, avoidance, and collisions associated with offshore wind infrastructure. In the terrestrial environment, there are two databases which could inform development of an offshore database, Nature Counts and AWWIC. The Nature Counts database collects bat fatality information from Canadian land-based wind facilities. The American Wind Wildlife Information Center (AWWIC) collects post-construction fatality data from U.S., land-based wind facilities. Database managers work with wind industry collaborators to compile both publicly available and privately contributed fatality data, including important covariates (e.g., effort, methodology, meteorological conditions), and to allow for the analysis of these data by Renewable Energy Wildlife Institute (REWI) staff, as well as other researchers.  Careful limitations on data sharing and requirements for sharing aggregated data ensure that no data from private sources could lead to identification of individual wind facilities.\nOne challenge associated with the AWWIC database is that it includes tailored non-disclosure agreements negotiated with each wind facility operator individually, and new data analyses and studies must often be negotiated with data contributors. An offshore collision fatality database for bats should instead include standard protocols for how data are collected, entered, and reported, including which covariates are necessary for interpretation. The database should also include clear data sharing standards to allow access for federal regulators and simplify sharing of data with outside researchers for analysis and synthesis, while addressing developer concerns regarding data security, confidentiality, and needs for data aggregation in reporting.\n\n\nF.6.1.2.2 Tissue Sample Repository\nThere is an identified need for a tissue repository to store tissue samples from bats, including carcasses of bats recovered from offshore wind facilities. These remnants are much less likely to be found at offshore facilities than at land-based facilities, since carcasses are most likely to fall into the ocean and not be recoverable and regular carcass searches are not likely to be proscribed. However, carcasses of bats may occasionally be recovered on offshore wind facility infrastructure incidentally. In addition, tissue samples may be collected from bats in offshore or coastal areas for various research purposes, including genetic, physiological, stable isotope, or disease dynamics studies.  If not destructively sampled for analysis as part of the initial study, these samples could be stored for later use and to benefit future analyses.\nAt present, there is one repository which accepts bat carcasses recovered at renewable energy facilities. The Renewables-Wildlife Solutions Initiative (RWSI), organized by Todd Katzner (USGS) and Mark Davis (University of Illinois), has established a successful system for collecting and tracking bat samples from wind facilities, including sample storage and an Access database. The organizers are open to accepting samples and carcasses from offshore wind facilities. However, this small-scale repository could easily be overwhelmed if all bat carcasses and tissue samples currently collected or stored by state agencies, federal agencies, wind developers, and environmental consultants were to suddenly begun to be shipped to these locations.\nUSGS researchers, working with colleagues, have mapped out a hierarchical structure for a database that could allow for the tracking of carcasses and tissue subsamples throughout the country. There has also been discussion of logistical needs – for example, the establishment of regional collection centers to reduce transportation/shipping challenges for frozen samples. As of 2023, this plan has not been implemented. While development of a tissue sample repository would be of great value to renewable energy-wildlife research, it is likely of lower priority for offshore wind facilities where, as noted, collection of carcasses and tissue samples is likely to occur less frequently.\n\n\nF.6.1.2.3 Raw File Data Repository\nIn addition to databases, there is a need for a data repository to store raw data with large file types – e.g., radar data, thermal video, and raw acoustic files. Derived data from these types of files should be made available in relational databases as relevant; however, the raw data should also be retained in a central location for quality control, re-analysis, and future re-evaluations with better tools. For example, future machine learning advances may allow for faster and more effective automated identification of bat species in acoustic files.\nThe NABat database currently accepts raw acoustic files (field-collected files that have not auto-classified or manually identified to species) in addition to processed data with temporally and spatially located species identifications, but if this platform were to accept large volumes of acoustic files, it would quickly be overwhelmed.\n\n\n\nF.6.1.3 Current and Recent Efforts\nMotus. Automated telemetry data collected via the Motus Wildlife Tracking Network is automatically stored in the Motus system.Hence, historical data for bats are naturally stored alongside data collected from current and recent projects. Birds Canada staff have also made efforts in recent years to solicit tag metadata associated with tag deployment from past projects where not previously recorded in the Motus system.\nNABat. As noted above, the NABat sampling grid has been extended offshore. The NABat database can accept presence/absence bat acoustic data collected from offshore wind turbines, associated infrastructure, meteorological towers, and other offshore, island, or coastal locations (e.g., offshore weather buoys, lighthouses, tree-mounted units on islands). The NABat database also allows for inclusion of bat acoustic data collected as part of boat-based surveys. In addition, any bat observation data types may also be submitted to the database.\n\n\n\nF.6.2 Data Analysis & Planning\nData analyses and summaries should inform where new data collection is needed, characterize bat activity and distribution patterns in coastal and offshore environments, and/or address the efficacy of monitoring or mitigation strategies.\n\nF.6.2.1 Recommended Science Actions\nIn order to address near-term needs, the Bird & Bat Subcommittee recommends:\n\nAs data are collected, analysis to evaluate collision risk and relate offshore bat activity and collision risk to meteorological conditions, turbine characteristics, and turbine operational status. (If mitigation is deemed necessary in the future, these analyses could be used to design and implement efficient operational mitigation measures, such as curtailment.)\nContributions of new and historical data to the NABat database to allow for the extension of seasonal occupancy and abundance maps/estimates offshore.\nDevelopment of a framework to evaluate population-scale risks of offshore collision mortality to bats, in a context of great uncertainty. Identification of the data needed to inform and validate models.\n\n\n\nF.6.2.2 Current and Recent Efforts\nOffshore Bat Activity. As referenced above, Donald Solick and Christian Newman at EPRI recently published a literature review (Solick and Newman, 2021) summarizing the state of knowledge regarding bat occurrences offshore, particularly with respect to offshore wind development.\nData Gaps Analysis. Project WOW, a Wildlife and Offshore Wind study led by Duke University, with collaborators, is performing a data gaps analysis to understand where sufficient data exist to generate meaningful estimates of likely impacts, and where they do not. This analysis will be based on a quantitative scoring of literature, based on species names and taxa. For a preliminary summary of this analysis, see Meeting 4 in the public RWSC files.\nSummary of Research Priorities. The NYSERDA E-TWG Regional Synthesis Workgroup was organized to inform and provide interim guidance for regional-scale research and monitoring of offshore wind energy and wildlife in the eastern United States. With technical support from BRI, the group compiled a database of research needs and data gaps from existing sources, including published, peer-reviewed synthesis papers, State of the Science Workgroups, federal and state agency efforts, and previous E-TWG Specialist Committees, etc. The database was designed to synthesize existing data gaps and research needs so that researchers and funders can easily access, sort, and further prioritize topics. The database specifies focal taxa, spatial scale, and other information relating to each priority research topic. The Workgroup also drafted written guidance, including definitions of common terminology to support regional communications, general suggested criteria for prioritization of regional research topics, and general recommendations on study design and data transparency for regional-scale research efforts.\nCurtailment Efficacy. In the terrestrial environment, several recent meta-analyses have considered the efficacy of curtailment in reducing bat fatalities at land-based facilities:\n\nAdams et al. (2021): https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0256382 \nWhitby et al. (2021): https://tethys.pnnl.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Whitby-et-al-2021.pdf\n\nBat Attraction to Turbines. Theories about causes of bat attraction to wind turbines have also been recently addressed. Guest et al. (2022) provided an updated review of hypotheses regarding bat attraction to wind turbines: https://doi.org/10.3390/ani12030343.\nMotus Network Coordination. The Motus network continues to expand through the work of Birds Canada, USFWS, and many other collaborators. However, the system could benefit from a more coordinated and less piecemeal approach towards deployment of Motus stations, in an arrangement that maximizes detection probabilities for focal species. In addition, centralized calibration and maintenance efforts, to ensure stations are functioning and to measure detection ranges systematically, would also be of benefit for scientific rigor and cost savings. In summer 2020, USFWS organized initial meetings among stakeholders to discuss the value of coordinating and possibly centralizing calibration of Motus stations, as well as deployment of both Motus stations and VHF radiotags for automated telemetry in the offshore environment. Phase 1 of the project would include efforts by RWSC to develop a plan for coordination and centralization, incorporating the Offshore Motus Framework, highlighting subregions/sites and species of interest, proposing a design or framework for optimal or strategic tag deployment, listing key participants (tag project funders, species and land managers, etc.), and describing data standardization practices.\nEfficient Curtailment Regimes. “Smart” curtailment systems incorporate algorithms that allow for cost-efficient operational curtailment regimes, which can reduce risk of bat collisions while also minimizing energy production losses due to curtailment. These algorithms and technologies are currently being developed for land-based facilities, but could be adapted for offshore use if need be.  One summary presentation of the various projects supported through recent U.S. Department of Energy funding is available from Tethys, but more recent individual updates are also available.\nEstimating Population-Level Impacts. Determining whether collision fatalities are likely to have population-level impacts on bat species can be difficult due to lack of knowledge about their current population sizes, as well as survival and fecundity metrics. Several recent analyses have provided statistical frameworks to evaluate potential impacts of land-based wind fatalities on hoary bat populations (Frick et al., 2017; Whitby et al., 2021). It would be valuable to agree upon a common framework for risk assessments to bat populations at land-based and offshore wind facilities, including thresholds for implementing mitigation.\n\n\n\nF.6.3 Technology Advancement\nTechnological advances can lead to more effective and more cost-efficient monitoring and mitigation strategies for bats in coastal and marine environments. Section 6.3.1 summarizes recommended science actions. Section 6.3.2 provides detail on current and recent efforts related to technological advancement.\n\nF.6.3.1 Recommended Science Actions\nRecommended actions include:\n\nTesting and validating bat collision detection systems (recognizing that initial validation may need to focus on land-based wind facilities, where carcass counts are possible).\nImproving access to remote wildlife monitoring data and integrating wildlife monitoring equipment on wind turbine platforms or other offshore infrastructure. This could include identifying workflows to allow for the transmission of wildlife monitoring data using existing wind facility fiber-optic networks. This could also include developing a standard module that could be added on to turbines to house and provide power and data access for a variety of wildlife monitoring equipment.\nDesigning and improving auto-classification of acoustic data to identify species or taxa.\nImproving tagging technologies and attachment methods to allow for lighter tags and longer-term tracking.\nIf mitigation is deemed necessary, testing and validating the efficacy of on-site mitigation strategies (e.g., feathering, curtailment, deterrents). (As noted above, validation of mitigation in the offshore environment will be difficult, and the development of effective bat collision detection systems, validated at land-based wind facilities, would be necessary for validation of mitigation measures in the offshore environment. Alternatively, efficacy would need to be estimated based on land-based proxies and the best available science.)\n\n\n\nF.6.3.2 Current and Recent Efforts\n\nF.6.3.2.1 Research and Development (R&D) Needs for Wildlife Monitoring\nA recent study carried out by Advisian and BRI through funding by the National Offshore Wind R&D Consortium, focused on identifying technology gaps for monitoring birds and marine mammals in relation to offshore wind farms, including the capabilities of available monitoring technologies to collect statistically robust data and to be integrated into typical offshore wind infrastructure and operations. The end goal of the project, which included assessment of existing systems as well as workshops with expert stakeholders, was to develop targeted recommendations for technology innovation where further tech development or coordination could improve the capabilities of monitoring to answer key research questions and better inform future mitigation and adaptive management of offshore wind development. While not focused on bats, the results are of relevance to all taxa.\n\n\nF.6.3.2.2 Bat-Turbine Interaction & Collision Detection Technologies\nAs described in Section 4, there are a multitude of systems to detect collisions and, in some cases, bat behavior around turbines, which incorporate some combination of cameras, acoustics, radar and/or impact detection systems. These systems are in various stages of development, field-testing, and validation at land-based and/or offshore wind facilities. As noted above, for tracking of new technologies, see the Tethys database of monitoring technologies.\n\n\nF.6.3.2.3 Artificial Intelligence for Species Identification\nUse of artificial intelligence to identify acoustic detections of bats can significantly speed up processing time, reduce costs, and potentially increase accuracy. A number of auto-classifiers for bat acoustic data exist (BCID, Kaleidoscope Pro, Sonobat, Echoclass), but some researchers have identified strategies or areas with potential for improvement (Khalighifar and al., 2022). Manual identification of calls is still common – a practice that is not easily scalable.\nMachine learning projects designed to allow for the automatic tracking of flight paths in videos and radar are also being developed.\n\n\nF.6.3.2.4 Improvements in Tag Technology\nSatellite, GPS datalogger, and VHF tags are constantly improving, becoming smaller and lighter, and with greater longevity. However, many tags are still too heavy to be deployed on bats or deployed for long periods of time. Development of lighter tags and/or tags with longer range, longevity, and reliability could aid in more efficient and effective data collection. In addition, alternative attachment methods could allow for better tag retention on the bat (Castle et al., 2015; O’Mara et al., 2014).\n\n\n\n\nF.6.4 Field Data Collection\nIn coastal and marine environments, a number of field research methods can inform our scientific understanding of bat interactions with offshore wind facilities (for common methodologies, see Section 4). As part of Construction and Operations Plans (COPs), offshore wind developers are developing and submitting avian and bat monitoring plans. Of relevance to bats, current available draft monitoring plans typically include deploying passive acoustic detectors on turbines or other offshore wind facility infrastructure, deploying active acoustic detectors on work vessels accessing the facility, and deploying and maintaining Motus receiver stations for a specified number of years post-construction. State agencies, federal agencies, and research organizations regularly deploy acoustic detectors in coastal environments. Motus or standard VHF tags are also occasionally deployed on bats utilizing habitat in coastal areas.\n\nF.6.4.1 Recommended Science Actions\nAs part of addressing near and long-term goals, the Bird & Bat Subcommittee recommends the following field research, data interpretation, and technology advancement activities:\n\nData collection to characterize bat activity and collision risk in the rotor-swept zone of offshore wind turbines.\n\nUtilizing passive acoustic detectors mounted on turbine platforms, towers, and nacelles to document bat activity year-round.\nDeploying multi-modal systems on turbines to assess bat interactions with wind turbine infrastructure (including micro-avoidance and collision risk). Combinations of acoustic detectors, radar systems, impact detection sensors, and/or visual, thermal, and infrared cameras are recommended to document bat behavior around wind turbines, detect impacts, and, in some cases, provide species-specific identification.\nRecording contemporaneous turbine operational status and local meteorological data to inform patterns of bat activity, behavior, and collision risk relative to turbine operation and environmental conditions.\n\nUse of acoustics to better understand onshore-to-offshore gradients of bat activity pre- and post-construction. Leveraging existing platforms (e.g., vessels which already make regular trips through offshore waters, offshore buoys, other offshore infrastructure) and coastal and island sites will aid in this effort.\nUse of Motus tagging/tracking systems to characterize patterns of bat movement offshore (Acoustic studies alone may fail to fully capture bat activity if bats regularly refrain from echolocation while flying over the ocean (Corcoran et al., 2021; Corcoran and Weller, 2018).\nDeploying Motus tags on migratory tree bats (hoary bats, eastern red bats, silver-haired bats) to evaluate patterns of movement during the spring and late summer-fall migration seasons.\nDeploying Motus tags on Perimyotis and Myotis species of conservation concern in coastal areas and on islands in late summer to evaluate dispersal from maternity colonies to swarming or overwintering sites.\nCoordinating deployment of Motus stations to streamline calibration and optimize placement (see Appendix E).\n\n\n\nF.6.4.2 Current and Recent Efforts\nBecause of the number of individual researchers and organizations conducting bat research in coastal and marine environments, as well as the rapid development of offshore wind energy and associated Bat Monitoring Plans, any summary of coastal and offshore bat field research would be incomplete and would quickly become dated. In general, as noted above, readers are directed to the RWSC Offshore Wind & Wildlife Research Database for a compilation of recent, current, and pending projects. For projects not listed, researchers are strongly encouraged to submit a new entry for inclusion in the database. Planned research at offshore wind facilities, as outlined in Bat Monitoring Plans, is best tracked through Tethys Offshore Wind metadata.\nSeveral areas of field data collection are briefly noted, but not described in detail:\nMotus: There is a robust network of Motus telemetry stations along the Atlantic Coast, but this network requires maintenance, as well as further expansion in the offshore environment. As offshore wind facility operators develop wildlife monitoring plans for review by BOEM, many are including deployment of offshore Motus stations within the facility, as well as support for maintenance of adjacent coastal turbines. Several past studies used Motus tags to evaluate bat movements in coastal areas and offshore along the U.S. Atlantic Coast (Dowling, 2018; Peterson et al., 2021; True et al., 2023). To date, offshore wind developers have not included deployment of Motus tags on bats as part of wildlife monitoring plans.\nAcoustics: Past use of acoustics along the Atlantic Coast is summarized by Solick & Newman (2021), as noted above. More recently, boat-based and stationary (on turbines or other facility infrastructure) acoustic monitoring for bats has occurred at multiple offshore wind farms (e.g., Block Island, Dominion CVOW), and plans for acoustic monitoring are included in many offshore wind facility wildlife monitoring plans.\nBat-Turbine Interactions: Cameras and multi-modal systems have been deployed in the RWSC Study Area on turbines, including cameras used at the Block Island wind farm to assess nocturnal flight and collision risk and the Dominion CVOW project’s upgraded ATOM system, which includes two thermographic cameras operating in stereo to permit flight height calculations and document bat and bird activity in the rotor-swept zone.\n\n\n\n\nAdams, E.M., Gulka, J., Williams, K.A., 2021.

    "text": "G.1 Sea turtle species in the RWSC study area\nAll sea turtles in the U.S. are federally protected by the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and most states adopt the federal status for management purposes. In the U.S., sea turtles in water (foraging, migrating, oceanic dispersal, mating, disentanglement and stranding response) are managed federally by NOAA Fisheries and on land (nesting, rehabilitation and captive display) by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.\nSea turtles have a unique life history. They are generally long lived and, besides incubating eggs and emergent hatchlings, only adult females spend a brief period on beaches while nesting. For all six species found in U.S. waters combined, sea turtles can be found in the northwest Atlantic from shallow coastal waters, including brackish and inshore bays, sounds and river mouths to offshore pelagic waters. Collectively sea turtles may be the ESA listed species most commonly affected by offshore wind. They range in size from &lt;10cm Kemp’s ridley hatchlings to &gt;2m adult leatherbacks. In the oceanic dispersal stage, they feed in surface waters often associated with floating algae such as sargassum, as larger juveniles-adults, diets range from herbivorous adult green turtles to leatherbacks feeding primarily on gelatinous prey to Kemp’s ridley and loggerhead turtles that feed primarily on benthic crustaceans and mollusks.\nIn the U.S. Atlantic, sea turtles are migratory in temperate and northern sub-tropical areas and may live in relatively static or seasonally shifting home ranges in sub-tropical and tropical waters depending on the species and habitat.\nOn the U.S. Atlantic coast, loggerhead and green turtles regularly nest from Florida to North Carolina. Loggerheads nesting in the U.S. belong to the NW Atlantic DPS, and greens belong to the N Atlantic DPS. Small numbers of loggerheads annually nest in southeastern Virginia and occasional nests of both species have been reported north of Virginia. In the same region, leatherback turtles nest primarily in Florida and numbers have fluctuated at index beaches but have generally increased since the late 1980s. Occasional Kemp’s ridley and hawksbill turtles nest on the U.S. Atlantic coast, hawksbills in Florida and Kemp’s ridleys from FL to VA. Extralimital nesting outside of known nesting areas have been documented for all turtle species.\nThere is no parental investment after a nest is laid and hatchlings emerge from nests, make their way to the water and swim frenetically until they reach offshore habitat where they spend several years to over a decade in an oceanic dispersal stage. For northwest Atlantic green and loggerhead turtles, we believe this life stage is spent primarily in the Gulf Stream and Sargasso Sea. Little is known about NW Atlantic leatherbacks in the oceanic dispersal stage. Most Kemp’s ridleys nest in the Gulf of Mexico and some of these turtles exit the Gulf and are dispersed into the northwest Atlantic most likely via the Gulf Stream.\nHealthy juvenile through adult life stage sea turtles are considered ‘surfacers’ instead of ‘divers’ meaning that most of their time is spent below the surface, and, with a couple of exceptions, they only come to the surface briefly to breathe (Kooyman, 1989). One exception to this mostly subsurface lifestyle is basking behavior which has been exhibited by loggerhead turtles on the outer continental shelf, mostly in the spring months as they are migrating north to summer foraging areas (Hochscheid et al., 2010). Post-hatchling turtles in the dispersal phase (Phillips, 2022) also appear to spend most of their time in the top several meters of the water column.\nMovement from the oceanic dispersal life stage to the juvenile-adult neritic life stages occurs at different age and size for loggerhead, green, and Kemp’s ridley turtles. Little is known about leatherback distribution from hatchling to sub-adult life stages.\nBecause their behavior and distribution varies among life stages, the Science Plan will address research priorities by species, life stage and subregion (Table 1). Thus, for the remainder of this document, sea turtle life stages will be defined as:\nEgg/hatchling – for the conservation purposes of the RWSC, we are combining incubating egg in nests with hatchling emergence and swimming frenzy; beach phase including incubation, emergence & swim frenzy that results in arrival in offshore pelagic habitat.\nJuvenile dispersal – ‘lost years’ life stage, post-hatching dispersal where turtles are near the surface, in open water. Off the U.S. Atlantic coast these small turtles are thought to be distributed primarily in the Gulf Stream and Sargasso Sea. Little is known about the dispersal life stage for leatherback turtles, and this life stage primarily occurs in the Gulf of Mexico for Kemp ridley turtles (Phillips, 2022).\nJuvenile-subadult (post dispersal)– foraging phase of sexually immature turtles (neritic habitat for Kemp’s ridley, green and loggerhead turtles in the NW Atlantic; pelagic and neritic for NW Atlantic leatherbacks), characterized in some species and subregions by north/south and/or inshore offshore seasonal migrations or seasonally shifting home ranges.\nAdult – sexually mature; loggerheads nest in the Central Atlantic and Southern Atlantic subregions, green and leatherback turtles almost exclusively in the Southern Atlantic, occasional nests of all species are found outside normal nesting areas. Females of most populations have an inter-nesting period of &gt;1 year. Non-breeding and post-breeding/nesting adults may behave seasonally much like juveniles and sub-adults. Tracking data suggest foraging occurs outside of nesting areas in post-nesting females.\nTable 1: Sea turtle species and life stage covered by this plan by subregion (UN=unknown, NA=not applicable,

caretta), 2) green (Chelonia mydas), 3) leatherback (Dermochelys coriacea), 4) Kemp’s ridley (Lepidochelys kempii), and 5) hawksbill (Eretmochelys imbricata), the first four species, which occur consistently in the RWSC study area, are considered focal species for this chapter. The first three species regularly nest on U.S. Atlantic coast beaches, and the other two occasionally nest on U.S. Atlantic beaches. Table 1 indicates that the sea turtle species, occurrence, and life stages in the RWSC study that will be considered in this plan by sub-region. Of the five species that occur in the NW Atlantic, the plan will cover four of them, all but hawksbill. Sea turtles occur from inshore bays and river mouths to pelagic waters and use habitats in different ways during their life stages. Table 2 indicates the life stage and behavioral states of the species considered under the plan as well as the estimated inshore and offshore boundaries of the plan.\n\n\nG.1.2 RWSC Sub-regions and regional scale sea turtle distribution\nRWSC is organized by subregion along the U.S. Atlantic coast, roughly aligned with current offshore wind development planning areas. RWSC subregions and map are described in the Chapter 1.\nIn this document, region wide ongoing, pending and recommended field research is briefly described, discussed and organized into one of several research themes described in the Chapter 1. Details of ongoing and pending research and long-term monitoring efforts informative to the questions regarding OSW are available in the searchable RWSC Offshore Wind and Wildlife Research Database, and links to queries for each research project are included in the tables describing projects in the chapter. Following regionwide field research, is discussion of field research specific to each subregion. Following subregion field data collection discussion, are on-going, pending and recommended non-field efforts by research theme and action. Non-field data collection actions include: 1) outreach and platforms to provide data products/results to stakeholders; 2) coordination and planning; 3) standardizing data collection, analysis, and reporting; 4) study optimization; 5) historic data collection/compilation; 6) model development and statistical frameworks; 7) technology advancement; 8) manipulative experiments, and 9) meta-analysis and literature review and are further described in Chapter 1.\n\nG.1.2.1 Regional-scale distribution information\nConsistent data to capture spatial and temporal distribution is provided via survey effort. In addition, tag, sighting, stranding and bycatch data contribute to distribution information, especially in areas and times where survey effort is limited and under conditions where turtles are not likely to be detected. While there has been a substantial amount of survey effort conducted to detect large sea turtles in the NW Atlantic, turtle distribution and behavior is variable both within and between seasons and is likely affected directly and indirectly by a combination of environmental factors. As such, abundance estimates should be based on multiple years and seasons of data (NOAA Fisheries, 2020). Currently, a thorough understanding of surface availability and abundance is lacking for all species in much of the NW Atlantic. For some species and subregions, especially sub-adult loggerheads in shelf waters of USCA through SNE subregions, availability estimates are based on relatively large data sets, but still contain some data gaps (Hatch and al., 2022). Importantly, most recent distance sampling aerial surveys (AMAPPS) have been conducted using parameters appropriate for detecting a variety of species. The speed and altitude at which most of these surveys were conducted prevent detection of smaller turtles (&lt;40cm carapace length) (NOAA Fisheries, 2020; Palka et al., 2021), and all turtle detections decrease in sub-optimal conditions, especially with increasing sea state. Regardless of the survey effort level, substantial data gaps on sea turtle distribution and abundance exist for all species, seasons and subregions.\nEfforts to develop an index of abundance and distribution using satellite tag data for loggerhead turtles by month were conducted by Winton et al. (Winton and al., 2018). Loggerheads used nearly all shelf waters from Long Island, NY south to near the tip of peninsular FL. In winter months, loggerhead turtles were largely south of the Virginia-North Carolina border. This analysis was possible due to a large tag dataset with similarly programmed tags for animals captured and tagged with broad temporal and spatial variation. Similar efforts may yield better results for other species if undertaken as a coordinated effort.\nThe U.S. Navy recently completed a sea turtle surface density modeling project along the U.S. Atlantic coast from shore to the EEZ which produced estimates for the NW Atlantic for juvenile-adult stage turtles large enough to be detected from a variety of platforms (DiMatteo and Sparks, 2022), those surveys are available as East Coast Turtle Density Models on OBIS SEAMAP. Estimates of sea turtle abundance are not yet available from AMAPPS surveys. Tagging results of loggerhead and leatherback turtles from AMAPPS surveys are available in AMAPPS reports (Palka et al., 2021).\n\n\nG.1.2.2 Biologically Important Areas for sea turtles within U.S. Waters\nBiologically important areas in the United States for NW Atlantic sea turtle species/populations have not been determined. State space modeling applied to telemetry studies suggest that inshore and coastal continental shelf habitat are important foraging areas for loggerhead (Braun-McNeill et al., 2008; Evans et al., 2019) and Kemp’s ridley (Bean and Logan, 2019) turtles in the Central Atlantic and New York Bight subregions. Work is underway through AMAPPS research to establish similar areas of importance for leatherback turtles (C. Sasso pers comm). Although all established Kemp’s ridley nesting areas are in the Gulf of Mexico, the coastal and inshore waters of the NW Atlantic appear to be important foraging areas for juvenile and subadult Kemp’s ridley turtles although the contribution of this region to the population remained unclear in the 2015 status review for the species (NOAA and USFWS, 2015). A new proposed critical habitat designation for N Atlantic green turtles was released in July 2023 (NOAA Fisheries, 2023). It is expected that findings will discuss the northward expansion of the species as well as increases in nesting on Southern Atlantic beaches since the previous review in 2015 (Seminoff and al., 2015).\nBetter understanding of biologically important in-water sea turtle habitat is needed for all species in US Atlantic waters."

    "text": "G.2 Potential effects of offshore wind on sea turtles\nThe subcommittee recognizes that there may be positive, negative and/or mixed impacts of offshore wind development and operation on sea turtles. These effects may directly affect individual animals or indirectly affect them through changes to the environment, prey/predator distribution and/or changes in human activities. Animals and populations may be impacted by multiple, cumulative, effects, some positive and some negative.\nAs ectothermic, mostly migratory populations in U.S. Atlantic waters, some sea turtle population’s foraging, breeding, nesting, and migratory ranges overlap the areas proposed for offshore wind development in the Atlantic Ocean. In addition, sea turtle species are exposed to multiple and cumulative stressors throughout their life cycles, including climate and non-climate threats (Fuentes et al., 2013; Fuentes et al., 2020). The cumulative effect of these and other stressors are likely to create biologically significant population level responses.\nThere have been no studies describing the effects of construction and operation of windfarms on sea turtles, largely because most research has come from European and U.K. waters, where sea turtles do not commonly occur. Discussion of potential impacts of offshore wind on each sea turtle species are, therefore, based on data from other species groups or other potential stressors. The subcommittee is concerned that this lack of knowledge for sea turtle species, which have a very different life history, compared to other species groups, plays into sea turtle risk assessments and adds potential for more unexpected results, compared to other wildlife impacted by OSW. Without risk assessment specific to sea turtles, unidentified impacts cannot be assessed or mitigated with enhanced monitoring and adaptive management. The subcommittee recommended exploring the use of cumulative impact assessment whereby multiple threats to sea turtles were quantified allowing for effective mitigation and restoration recommendations following the Gulf of Mexico Deep Water Horizon Oil Spill. Love et al. (Love et al., 2017) categorized, quantified, and assessed the threats to (stressors) sea turtles to identify the most effective restoration actions for the recovery of sea turtle populations in the Gulf of Mexico. The authors were able to quantify poor and missing information in their assessment through use of proxy and modeled data. A similar approach to identifying sea turtle threats and quantifying the potential impact of OSW may be helpful in determining the most effective methods for assessing and addressing threats in U.S. Atlantic waters.\nOSW, like other human activities in the marine environment, will have effects on sea turtles. Positive effects will most likely be related to reef effects of physical structures supporting turbines. Structures are expected to attract invertebrate fouling organisms and reef/wreck fishes, which will likely attract small schooling fishes (Glarou et al., 2020). Sea turtles have been documented around underwater structures and are likely attracted to them (Broadbent1 and al., 2020; Reimer et al., 2023). These structures will also attract anglers and some commercial fishers such as pot/trap fishers which may increase the likelihood of interactions with active and discarded gear. The most probable direct negative effects of offshore wind construction and operation are serious injury and mortality from increased vessel interaction and increase in fishery interaction because of attraction to turbines due to reef effects. It is likely that there will be direct, indirect and/or temporary negative effects related to noise, EMF, as well as changes in prey distribution, oceanographic parameters, fishing and shipping distribution. Other oceanographic and substrate impacts are not well understood, and impacts are yet to be determined.\nSince little is known about effects of OSW on sea turtles, the subcommittee must look to studies on large marine vertebrates for comparison. In European waters, researchers have documented avoidance and displacement effects, primarily of harbor porpoises (Phocoena phocoena). These effects occurred at ranges of 10-26 km from the whole footprint of offshore windfarms during construction (Benhemma Le Gall et al., 2021; Brandt et al., 2018; Dähne et al., 2013; Graham et al., 2023, 2019). All of these studies indicate that the distance and duration of avoidance is related to received noise, which is further influenced by source level, sound propagation conditions (environmental parameters, substrate type, etc.), hearing range of the studied species, distance to the noise source, duration of exposure, level and type of mitigation, and presence of other noise sources like construction vessels.\nFor harbor and grey seals, tagging data around wind energy sites in Europe showed behavior consistent with foraging after construction was completed (Russell et al., 2016; Russell et al., 2014). Pinnipeds appeared to either habituate quickly or to take advantage of wind farm physical structures as a foraging opportunity, whereas small dolphins and porpoises showed high variability in displacement and recovery response to wind farm construction and operations. Considerable research is still needed to understand sea turtle hearing sensitivity and behavioral responses to noise. Effects of noise associated with OSW construction and operation may be more similar to pinnipeds than cetaceans, which, as a species group, are more highly auditory and vocal in nature than sea turtles. To date, however, there is not a complete understanding of the ranges of sea turtle hearing or their physiological and behavioral responses to underwater noise such as pile driving associated with turbine construction or that associated with turbine operation.\nKraus et al. (Kraus et al., 2019) summarized the potential short-term and long-term effects of offshore wind development on marine mammals and sea turtles in Massachusetts and Rhode Island Wind Energy Areas. The list below is also relevant to the entire Atlantic coast. Any specific concerns related to sea turtle species in each subregion will be further described in the following sections of this chapter.\nPotential short-term effects of offshore wind construction activities (Kraus et al., 2019)\nPotential short-term effects include reaction to noise from pile driving, vessel operating noise, and impacts of an increased presence of vessels. These stressors could influence:\n\nDisplacement from wind energy areas\nDisruption to critical behaviors such as feeding, socializing, or nesting \nElevation of stress hormone levels\nChanges in vertical distribution, density, or patch structure of prey\n\nPotential long-term effects of offshore wind operation (Kraus et al., 2019)\nPotential long-term effects include wind turbine presence, and increased vessel activity to/from and near turbine fields. These stressors could influence:\n\nExclusion from or attraction to wind energy areas\nChanges to feeding opportunities\nEnhancements to marine productivity due to artificial reef effect around wind turbine foundations\n\nThe Sea Turtle Subcommittee also discussed potential impacts to sea turtles across the entire RWSC region. The Kraus et al. (Kraus et al., 2019) report addressed MA and Rhode Island, and thus only listed potential impacts in the GOM and SNE subregions which are limited to seasonal foraging habitat for neritic hard-shelled and leatherback turtles. Loggerhead, green and leatherback turtles have mating and nesting habitat in the USCA and USSEA subregions in addition to foraging and migratory habitat.\nBelow is an additional list of potential effects of concern identified by the subcommittee\n\nIncreased vessel interactions, lethal and non-lethal\nAcoustic disturbance\nEMF effects from underwater cables linking turbines and distributing electricity to shore\n\nPrey distribution – Some evidence of attraction to EMF (Albert et al., 2020)\nNavigation disturbance in foraging and migratory areas\nNesting disturbance (south of Chesapeake Bay)\nHatchling dispersal disturbance (south of Chesapeake Bay)\n\nOther\n\nChanges in habitat from structure effects on water column stratification, frontal field, current velocity/direction, thermocline, halocline\nReef effects\nTemporal and/or spatial changes in turtle and/or prey distribution due to warm water effluent from underwater DC substations\nChanges in entanglement/ingestion risk because of changes in distribution of fishing gear and aquaculture structures (especially increased fixed gear in lease areas)\nInteraction with floating/surface components and/or rotor intakes that could trap sargassum in off shelf planning areas"

    "section": "G.3 Methods and approaches",
    "text": "G.3 Methods and approaches\nTo address questions about sea turtles and the potential concerns with respect to offshore wind development, the Science Plan describes commonly used methods and approaches for data collection and research in Chapter 1. The following categories of methods are used throughout this chapter, but the Subcommittee recognizes that different tools, technologies, and/or procedures could be implemented with respect to each.\n\nG.3.1 Aerial and vessel-based line transect observational surveys\nLarge scale abundance data for sea turtles is generally collected using distance sampling surveys conducted from aerial, shipboard, and, in future, unmanned platforms such as drones.\nIn order to accurately estimate turtle abundance and/or density, aerial and vessel surface turtle counts are corrected for bias including perception bias and availability bias. Perception bias is the likelihood that observers will detect a turtle at the surface. Unlike small cetaceans such as dolphins and porpoises, turtles do not travel in groups and are relatively cryptic at the surface with no visible blow (exhalation) to cue observers. Thus, it is likely that a proportion of turtles that are at the surface are missed by observers and the proportion that are missed is correlated with increasing sea state, turbidity and glare. Availability bias incorporates the likelihood that an animal will be at the surface and available to be detected compared with the likelihood it will be subsurface and unable to be detected (unavailable). It is imperative to understand the relationship between number of turtles detected at the surface, those that are available to be detected, and the proportion of the population that is below the surface and unavailable to be detected. Again, compared to cetaceans which often travel in groups, detection of one individual in a group cues the observer to focus on a particular area increasing the likelihood of detection. A single diving turtle may only be perceived as a surface disturbance and not be identified to the species level.\nUnlike cetaceans, sea turtles surface time is highly variable by species, season, habitat, behavioral state, and other co-variates such as depth and water temperature. Because they are ectothermic, surface time is variable for sea turtles and complicates abundance estimation for these marine vertebrates over other species (Hatch and al., 2022). Surface time is estimated using tagged individuals, and, for sea turtles, should ideally be assessed at the time and location that surveys are being conducted. Minimally, tag data used to determine availability should include multiple years and individuals of all species being detected and include a range of animal sizes in all survey strata and seasons. Poor understanding of both perception and availability bias increases uncertainty in abundance estimates.\nBecause sea turtle abundance may be low and CV high for some species in some seasons of the RWSC study area, ability to detect changes in abundance and assigning causality to detected changes may be difficult. In a tech memo summarizing a workshop on estimating loggerhead turtle abundance in the NW Atlantic, NOAA estimated that ten years of survey data may be needed to develop robust loggerhead turtle abundance estimates in the NW Atlantic and that current protocols are unable to detect turtles less than 40cm carapace length (NOAA Fisheries, 2020).\nOn page 15 of NOAA Tech Memo NMFS-OPR-67, authors list several next steps that are important elements in developing robust estimates for NW Atlantic loggerheads (NOAA Fisheries, 2020):\n\nDefine management needs relative to the ability of aerial surveys to detect changes in abundance across appropriate timeline(s). Define desired level of confidence in those abundance estimates.\nEstablish the optimal survey altitude for sea turtles by conducting additional experiments at altitudes between 500–1,000ft to examine/understand the size of turtles that can be seen and turtle behavior relative to the survey platform.\nConduct additional field testing to determine detectability of a range of turtle sizes under varying water clarity and sea state conditions.\nExplore the pros and cons of high resolution aerial photogrammetry and use of automatic pattern recognition, considering likely improvements in the next 5-10 years. Establish whether calibration or ground-truthing is needed for aerial photogrammetry using side-by-side flights with both photogrammetry and observers.\nEnsure relevant aspects of sea turtle life history (e.g., seasonal migrations, behavioral state) are considered appropriately in the development of the survey design.\nDesign and conduct an experiment to assess variability of abundance estimates through repeat aerial surveys.\nExplore whether existing satellite telemetry data are sufficient to assess the effects of sea state on surfacing behavior.\nRefine measures of surface availability\n\nTake stock of satellite telemetry data and identify data gaps relative to location, life stage, and behavioral state (foraging, migrating, interesting intervals).\nDesign appropriate satellite telemetry experiment(s) to fill identified data gaps. o Assess the value of repeated counts to inform surface availability; compare to satellite telemetry approach; integrate methods to improve surface availability estimation.\n\nMine data from all relevant existing aerial surveys to inform a new survey design, including block identification if appropriate. Develop simulations to refine survey design.\nCoordinate survey design and implementation with other ongoing efforts to maximize efficiency and reduce duplication/overlap.\nDevelop funding estimates and consider potential funding sources, including leveraging existing funding. Develop a plan for and approach to seek funds.\n\n[Note that loggerheads are the most abundant sea turtle species in the NW Atlantic, perhaps by an order of magnitude over other species, making the complexity of developing robust abundance estimates for other species greater than for loggerheads.]\nThe subcommittee believes that few of the suggestions made at the workshop in 2016 have been fully accomplished and believes that most are needed for loggerheads as well as other turtle species. Providing funding and effort to better understand which turtles are being detected under what conditions, small turtle occurrence for green and Kemp’s ridley turtles estimates, and developing robust surface time estimates for all sea turtle species, in all subregions and seasons is critical for developing baseline abundance of sea turtle species.\nWithout this basic knowledge, assessing and mitigating impacts to sea turtles from a variety of sources, including offshore wind, will be extremely difficult.\n\n\nG.3.2 Tagging\nFor the purposes of this document, tagging refers to active tagging where tags transmit or archive data related to the tagged animal’s location, physiology and/or behavior. This is in contrast to passive tags such as flipper (Inconel) and subdermal (PIT) tags which are applied to an animal and must later be detected on that animal during subsequent observations. Tagging individual sea turtles includes the use of satellite and acoustic telemetry and may be paired with animal born and/or autonomous underwater cameras. The size of some turtles restricts the use of larger and heavier tags which limits battery life and additional instrumentation such as time depth recorders (TDRs) and GPS chips. To take advantage of the long battery life of tags used in acoustic telemetry, tags are often inserted internally into the target animals. Currently this methodology is not an accepted permit activity for research on wild turtles and has been experimentally allowed on stranded, rehabilitated and released turtles. The results of a recent pilot project conducted by the New England Aquarium may further the use of this method for sea turtle research (Innis et al., 2023).\n\n\nG.3.3 eDNA\nEnvironmental DNA (eDNA) is DNA released from an organism into the environment via feces, mucus, shed skin, hair, etc. It is detected in air, water, and substrate samples and requires assays from the organisms to be detected. eDNA is useful for determining presence of a species, population, or individual, but its utility as an index of abundance is unclear. Several organizations are developing eDNA assays for sea turtles and are ground truthing use of this technology in providing an index of abundance. Pilot studies at several sites are pending.\n\n\nG.3.4 Long-term monitoring - Stranding response, nest surveys, sightings databases, and observed takes (dredge & fishery)\nSea turtles only come ashore to nest, at the time of hatching, and when stranded (sick, injured, or dead). Nesting sea turtles in the U.S. are monitored annually on many beaches from Virginia through the U.S. Gulf coast, and several index beaches are established to provide long term indices of nesting turtle presence which are correlated with abundance. Nesting trends from index beaches which have been consistently monitored over decades are the primary data available for long-term population trend analysis for sea turtles in the U.S. Atlantic. An index of abundance has been established from long term nest monitoring data at specific sites in the Southern Atlantic subregion and in areas where turtles are resident or have relatively small seasonally shifting home ranges through capture/recapture studies.\nAlthough many caveats exist with use of stranding data, the U.S. Sea Turtle Stranding and Salvage Network may be another source of distribution and phenological trend information.\nIn addition, where survey data have few detections, citizen science sightings databases can add information on sea turtle presence. There is at least one curated long-term sightings database curated by Mass Audubon that can provide information about individual sightings of species that are small and are not easily detected with most survey methodologies.\nFinally, dredge and fishery observers record takes associated with permitted and authorized activities in many regions. Observers follow established protocols and receive substantial training. Though relatively rare, observed takes may also provide information on turtle presence in areas where abundance data are low. This is particularly true of offshore areas where distribution data may be poor for some species.\nAnalyses of long-term data sets may provide the basis for future hypotheses regarding baseline population and distribution trends for sea turtle species, but these data sets have not always been consistently collected or reviewed and experience of data collectors for some monitoring data sets varies widely."

    "text": "G.4 Sea turtle research topics\nThe RWSC Sea Turtle Subcommittee recognizes that impacts to sea turtles associated with OSW have not been studied since much of the previous work has been done in European waters where sea turtles are not commonly observed. The subcommittee also recognizes that impacts to sea turtles individually and at population levels are likely to be indirect, cumulative, synergetic and difficult assign to a single cause. Disentangling the effects on sea turtles of climate change from any potential effects from offshore wind development will be a major challenge.\nRWSC has established several Research Themes for the study of impacts to wildlife by OSW that build on work conducted by previous groups, on other wildlife species. In subsequent sections, many of the detailed questions, hypotheses, and potential approaches that correspond to these Research Themes are described for regional-scale studies and for each subregion (Gulf of Maine-GOM; Southern New England-SNE; New York/New Jersey Bight-NYB; US Central Atlantic-USCA; US Southeast Atlantic-USSEA).\n\nG.4.1 Regional Field data collection and analysis\nOngoing and pending regional field data collection and analysis projects are listed in the RWSC Research Database. Below are recommendations for regional field data collection and analysis for sea turtles.\n\nNMFS Long-term protected species, fisheries, and ecosystem surveys form the backbone of the scientific monitoring system needed for the management of wildlife, fisheries, habitats, and ecosystems. In order to understand potential changes in wildlife and habitats from offshore wind energy development, it is critical that long-term standardized surveys provide timely, accurate, and precise data on wildlife, habitats, and ecosystems. The need to fully implement the NMFS and BOEM Survey Mitigation Strategy (Hare et al., 2022) and review the strategy to directly affect sea turtle survey needs is critical to putting site and regional level studies in the context of population trends and ecosystem conditions. The Strategy calls for the development of a Northeast Survey Mitigation Program.  This largely unfunded strategy should be fully funded and be a significant priority for the region as well as for the Atlantic waters of the Southeast region.\nIncrease level of regional-scale sea turtle species data collection including surveys designed to detect all sizes of sea turtles and at sea tagging through AMAPPS, BOEM, and US Navy projects\nEmploy recommendations by NMFS to enhance AMAPPS sea turtle abundance estimates listed in (NOAA Fisheries, 2020), especially detection studies of all sea turtle species and sizes under a variety of conditions\nEnhance and expand abundance estimation, surface density estimates and habitat modeling using all appropriate forms of turtle occurrence data, including, but not limited to, verified sightings, strandings, bycatch data and prey distribution to determine biologically important areas for each sea turtle species in each RWSC subregion\n\n\n\nG.4.2 Regional Non-field research by type of action\n\nG.4.2.1 Recommended coordination and planning\n\nSpecifically request that emphasis on sea turtles be included in the Federal Survey Mitigation Strategy as they are all ESA species likely to be impacted by OSW development and possibly by operation once construction is complete\nExplore the possibility of quantifying cumulative stressors on sea turtles similar to assessments conducted following the Deep Water Horizon Oil Spill (Love et al., 2017) to better understand potential impacts of OSW compared with other threats sea turtles face in the NW Atlantic.\nCoordinate and initiate collaborations with additional partners to facilitate data and information sharing, including the Sea Turtle Stranding and Salvage Network, organizations conducting sea turtle nest monitoring, sea turtle rescue organizations operating under USFWS permits and authorization as well as satellite, acoustic and other tag data\nDevelop collaborations with fish scientists and other acoustic telemetry users to implement a long-term archival acoustic detection network in the NW Atlantic Ocean, following sea turtle optimization analysis to guide future detector and tag deployments\nWork with the sea turtle research and rescue community to determine whether development of a cache of tags suitable for sea turtles (acoustic and satellite; possibly through RWSC) would assist organizations that have needs for a small/unpredictable number of tags for deployment\nWork with the sea turtle research and rescue community to determine whether the use of a data portal (similar to a combination of seaturtle.org & Movebank) would facilitate collaborative tagging studies, especially for determining baseline behavioral metrics and surface time estimates\nWork with USFWS & the GARS stranding network to apply for regionwide rehab turtle tagging permit in support of OSW research\nWork with NMFS & USFWS to encourage acceptance of internal acoustic tagging with SOP\n\n\n\nG.4.2.2 Recommended historical data collection/compilation\n\nCompile inventory of satellite/GPS tags deployed on sea turtles since 2010 (?) for future collaborative studies.

In some cases, needs are specific to a single subregion, other data/research needs apply to more than one subregion.\n\n\n\nG.4.3 Gulf of Maine (GOM) data gaps, recommended research, and data collection activities for sea turtles\n\nG.4.3.1 Focal species and habitats of interest in the GOM\nThe Gulf of Maine subregion is seasonal foraging habitat for all sea turtle species covered by the Plan but, with the exception Cape Cod Bay, might be considered marginal habitat for Kemp’s ridley and green turtles. Wild caught loggerhead and leatherback turtles have been tracked in and out of the Gulf of Maine, including, but not exclusive of Cape Cod Bay (Dodge et al., 2014; Palka et al., 2021), and individuals of both species have been bycaught in the Atlantic Canadian longline fishery, suggesting seasonal distribution in the region(James et al., 2007; James et al., 2006; Paul et al., 2010). Suitable leatherback turtle habitat off Nova Scotia has been identified using both leatherback and Mola sightings along with environmental correlates in modeling analyses (A. Mosnier et al., 2018). Jellyfish distribution has also been used to predict leatherback distribution (Nordstrom et al., 2020).\nMost individuals are juveniles (Kemp’s ridley, green, loggerhead) and subadults (loggerhead), but adult leatherbacks can also be found in the subregion (Dodge et al., 2014).\nBetter understanding of the importance of Cape Cod Bay for juvenile Kemp’s ridley and green turtles is needed as it appears to be the primary area of the subregion in which these two species occur. For smaller individuals, primarily Kemp’s ridley and green turtles, there is a paucity of sightings in historic aerial and shipboard abundance surveys (DiMatteo and Sparks, 2022; Palka et al., 2021) and relatively few opportunistic citizen science sightings reported to the Sea Turtle Sighting Hotline for New England Boaters. A query of historic strandings of hard shelled turtles (loggerhead, Kemp’s ridey, green) from Cape Cod Bay north through Maine from April-early November (outside of cold stun season) resulted in a total of 50 strandings from 2013-2022, an average of five per year. All strandings occurred in MA, and 25 were loggerhead, 23 Kemp’s ridley, one green turtle and one possible hybrid. Low sightings combined with relatively few green turtles in the stranding record outside of the late fall cold stun season (STSSN unpublished data received 2 May 2023) raise questions about the role of the GOM subregion in the ecology of this species. Paucity of detections from survey, sighting and stranding data is not sufficient to hypothesize that the GOM subregion is not important habitat for Kemp’s ridley turtles because these small juvenile turtles are difficult to detect from planes and vessels. Though stranding numbers were low overall, the similarity of loggerhead and Kemp’s ridley strandings in addition to very high numbers of cold stunned Kemp’s ridleys in late fall call into question whether Kemp’s ridleys are present in Cape Cod Bay in similar numbers as loggerheads.\nAssuming that cold stunned sea turtle numbers in Cape Cod Bay are representative of cheloniid habitat-use, this region could constitute important seasonal habitat for Kemp’s ridleys, followed by loggerheads, with less importance for green sea turtles. There is concern, however, what type of ecological impact the area may have on the Kemp’s ridley population given the high numbers of cold stunned turtles that are reported each year. Few if any of the hundreds of turtles would survive cold stunning without human intervention. Global climate change is likely to result in increasing numbers of hard-shelled turtles in this region, thus regular reassessment of turtle occurrence in the GOM will be necessary.\nBecause baseline data for sea turtles in the GOM is relatively sparse and most turtle species, with the exception of leatherbacks, are not present in high enough densities to detect changes in abundance with any confidence, determining and studying impacts on a subregion-wide and/or population level are unlikely to be successful. The subcommittee suggests that small, focused studies on individual animal movement and behavior that are site specific may be most effective strategies for assessing impacts in the GOM.\n\n\nG.4.3.2 Potential effects of concern specific to the GOM subregion\nIn addition to the potential regionwide effects discussed in Section 2 of this chapter, there may be different effects due to turbine designs needed for the deeper waters in this subregion. Because of depth in the federal portion of GOM, turbines used to develop wind energy areas in this subregion will be floating units (Musial et al., 2016). It is currently unclear whether this technology will have different impacts from turbines attached to the bottom. Use of this technology may provide opportunities for comparison studies with nearby installations in the Southern New England subregion. Rafts of debris and algae associated with a different surface footprint and floating turbine movement may impact turtles and their non-benthic prey in different ways than static, bottom anchored turbines. If floating designs incorporate subsurface rotors to maintain stability and position, small turtles and near surface (gelatinous) prey may be impacted in ways that they will not be impacted by static turbines.\n\n\nG.4.3.3 Recommended field data collection and analysis needs in the GOM subregion\n\nContinue regional-scale protected species data collection through AMAPPS survey and tagging studies or similar programs – emphasize GOM? Especially tagging\nSupplement AMAPPS data with methods that detect smaller species and juveniles, especially in Cape Cod Bay\nDetermine ecological role of Cape Cod Bay for juvenile Kemp’s ridley turtles through additional tagging and modeling that incorporated sighting and stranding data\nExplore potential impacts to sea turtles and gelatinous prey when they co-occur with floating turbines\n\n\n\n\nG.4.4 Southern New England (SNE) data gaps, recommended research, and data collection activities for sea turtles\n\nG.4.4.1 Focal species and habitats of interest in the SNE subregion\nThe Southern New England subregion is seasonal foraging habitat for all sea turtle species covered by the Plan. Leatherback and loggerhead turtles have been detected on distance sampling surveys conducted as part of the regional AMAPPS program as well as on smaller scale survey efforts used in addition to AMAPPS survey by a Navy abundance estimation effort (DiMatteo and Sparks, 2022; Palka et al., 2021). Capture, tag, release (loggerhead and leatherback), remote tagging (leatherback), and disentanglement (leatherback, loggerhead and Kemp’s ridley) have been conducted in the SNE subregion (Dodge et al., 2014; Hatch and al., 2022; Kara L. Dodge et al., 2022; Palka et al., 2021). Few Kemp’s ridley and green turtles were detected in the SNE subregion on AMAPPS surveys, but there were some unidentified hard-shelled turtles detected that may have been these species (Palka et al., 2021). Opportunistic sightings of Kemp’s ridley turtles are rare but consistently occur each year in summer and early fall in the Sea Turtle Sightings Database but sightings of green turtles are less consistent, and the subcommittee believes this subregion may also currently be a marginal habitat for green turtles (Sea Turtle Sighting Hotline for New England Boaters unpublished data received 23 May 2023).\n\n\nG.4.4.2 Potential effects of concern specific to the SNE subregion\nThe potential effects of offshore wind development are similar in this subregion as are discussed in Section 2 of this chapter. The imminent development of the Vineyard and South Fork Wind projects makes the SNE subregion of particular interest to the subcommittee, since we do not have data or published research from other wind developments in sea turtle habitat. Both projects had estimated foundation construction start dates in late spring 2023. Development in the SNE will pose the first opportunity to study sea turtle behavior during construction and operation of NW Atlantic wind turbines. It is unclear whether baseline abundance data for loggerhead and leatherback turtles in the SNE subregion will be sufficient to detect changes in abundance and/or distribution at the regional level using distance sampling techniques. Thus, smaller scale studies with a phase gradient experimental approach, focused on the development area and areas increasingly distant from the development (Ellis, J.I. and Schneider, D.C., 1997), as well as vessel corridors could be the focus of study in this subregion. Sea turtles should be included as a significant part of vessel co-occurrence and reef development studies. Turbine construction activities are designed to avoid times when critically endangered right whales were historically in the area (Jan-April), but these limitations will not avoid the times of highest sea turtle occurrence.\n\n\nG.4.4.3 Recommended field data collection and analysis in the SNE subregion\n\nDesign, plan, fund and conduct, long-term, small-scale studies specifically designed to determine effects on sea turtle species using multiple methodologies in the vicinity of wind projects currently under development in the SNE, NY/NJB and USCA regions. Tailor studies to take advantage of each subregion’s development timeline and unique sea turtle occurrence. Build on knowledge from each study to optimize results for future studies.\n\n\n\n\nG.4.5 New York/New Jersey Bight (NY/NJB) data gaps, recommended research, and data collection activities for sea turtles\n\nG.4.5.1 Focal species and habitats of interest in the NY/NJB subregion\nThe NY/NJ Bight subregion is seasonal foraging habitat for all sea turtle species covered by the Plan. Leatherback and loggerhead turtles have been detected on distance sampling surveys conducted as part of the regional AMAPPS program as well as on smaller scale survey efforts used in addition to AMAPPS survey by a Navy abundance estimation effort (DiMatteo and Sparks, 2022; Palka et al., 2021). Few Kemp’s ridley and green turtles were detected in the NY/NJB subregion on AMAPPS and other surveys, but there were some unidentified hard-shelled turtles detected that may have been these species (DiMatteo and Sparks, 2022; Palka et al., 2021). Kemp’s ridley and green turtles are sighted in Long Island Sound and all species regularly strand in the subregion (Montello et al., 2022). Capture, tag, and release (loggerhead) has been conducted in the subregion (Hatch and al., 2022; Winton and al., 2018) and numerous rehabilitated turtles have been released with tags, both acoustic and satellite (Robinson et al., 2020).\n\n\nG.4.5.2 Potential effects of concern specific to the NY/NJB subregion\nThe potential effects of offshore wind development are similar in this subregion as are discussed in Section 2 of this chapter. The imminent future development of the Empire Wind New York waters and Ocean Wind in New Jersey waters makes the NY/NJB subregion of interest to the subcommittee, since the timeline for these projects may allow for both pre- and post-construction assessment of the area. Permit applications have been submitted and permits are expected to be issued in 2023. Development in the NY/NJB will pose some of the first opportunities to study sea turtle behavior prior to approved construction. It is unclear whether baseline abundance data for loggerhead and leatherback turtles in the NY/NJB subregion will be sufficient to detect changes in abundance and/or distribution at the regional level using distance sampling techniques. Thus, the subcommittee recommends smaller scale studies focused on the development areas and areas adjacent to developments, as well as vessel corridors could be the focus of sea turtle studies in this subregion. Sea turtles should also be included as a significant part of vessel co-occurrence and reef development studies. Turbine construction activities will be designed to avoid times when critically endangered right whales were historically in the area, but these limitations are not likely to avoid the times of highest sea turtle occurrence.\n\n\nG.4.5.3 Recommended field data collection and analysis in the NY/NJB subregion\n\nDesign, plan, fund and conduct, long-term, small-scale studies specifically designed to determine effects on sea turtle species using multiple methodologies in the vicinity of wind projects currently under development in the SNE, NY/NJB and USCA regions. Tailor studies to take advantage of each subregion’s development timeline and unique sea turtle occurrence. Build on knowledge from each study to optimize results for future studies.\nCompile and analyze historic satellite and acoustic sea turtle tag data in the subregion. Analysis should focus on seasonal migratory timing, environmental correlated with animal movement, offshore distribution, and contribute to analyses on tag effort needed to develop robust surface time estimates for all species in all appropriate seasons.\n\n\n\n\nG.4.6 US Central Atlantic (USCA) data gaps, recommended research, and data collection activities for sea turtles\n\nG.4.6.1 Focal species and habitats of interest in the USCA subregion\nThe USCA subregion is seasonal foraging habitat for all sea turtle species covered by the Plan. In addition, this subregion represents the northern limits of consistent loggerhead nesting for the NW Atlantic DPS, and offshore waters including the Gulf Stream are likely to be habitat for post-hatchling dispersal stage (lost years) loggerhead and green turtles (Mansfield et al., 2021; Mansfield et al., 2014). All species covered by the plan have been detected on distance sampling surveys conducted as part of the regional AMAPPS program as well as on smaller scale survey efforts used in addition to AMAPPS survey by a Navy abundance estimation effort (Barco et al., 2018, 2015; DiMatteo and Sparks, 2022; Palka et al., 2021). Coastal ocean waters, Chesapeake Bay and North Carolina sounds act as important seasonal inshore foraging areas for loggerhead, Kemp’s ridley and green turtles (Braun-McNeill et al., 2008; DiMatteo and Sparks, 2022; Mansfield et al., 2009; McClellan and Read, 2009; McClellan and Read, 2007) and their spring and fall movement appears to be highly correlated with water temperature. It is likely that Delaware Bay is a similarly important foraging habitat. Capture, tag, and release (loggerhead and leatherback) has been conducted in the subregion (Hatch and al., 2022; Palka et al., 2021) and numerous rehabilitated turtles have been released with tags, both acoustic and satellite (Barco et al., 2015; Robinson et al., 2020). Fewer Kemp’s ridley and green turtles were detected in the USCA subregion than loggerheads and leatherbacks on AMAPPS surveys, but there were some unidentified hard-shelled turtles detected that may have been these species (DiMatteo and Sparks, 2022; Palka et al., 2021).\n\n\nG.4.6.2 Potential effects of concern specific to the USCA subregion\nThe potential effects of offshore wind development are similar in this subregion as are discussed in Section 2 of this chapter. The imminent future development of the CVOW project in VA waters makes the USCA subregion of interest to the subcommittee, since the timeline for these projects may allow for both pre- and post-construction assessment of the area. Additional projects off Maryland (US Wind) and northern North Carolina (Kitty Hawk Wind N) are farther away from construction than CVOW.  Unlike states to the north in the USCA region such as Maryland and southern New Jersey and states in subregions to the north of USCA, neither Virginia nor North Carolina are funded through power sharing agreements or other means to implement environmental monitoring projects independent of federal resources. For this reason, both the CVOW and Kitty Hawk N projects are unlikely to be the subject of meaningful monitoring or research outside of required mitigation without funding from federal sources. These two areas are likely have: 1) higher turtle densities of most species, 2) longer exposure seasonally and 3) active breeding and nesting adults than projects to the north and, for the reasons above, should be the focus of sea turtle oriented research on impacts of OSW on sea turtle species. In addition, restrictions on turbine construction activities designed to avoid times when critically endangered right whales will mean that construction will occur when densities for sea turtle species in this area are highest. Thus, the subcommittee recommends that federal funding for sea turtle impact studies around specific projects be focused on the CVOW and Kitty Hawk N development areas and areas adjacent to development including vessel corridors.\n\n\nG.4.6.3 Recommended field data collection and analysis in the USCA subregion\n\nDesign, plan, fund and conduct, long-term, small-scale studies specifically designed to determine effects on sea turtle species using multiple methodologies in the vicinity of wind projects currently under development in the SNE, NY/NJB and USCA regions. Tailor studies to take advantage of each subregion’s development timeline and unique sea turtle occurrence. Build on knowledge from each study to optimize results for future studies.\n\n\n\n\nG.4.7 US Southeast Atlantic (USSEA) data gaps, recommended research, and data collection activities for sea turtles\n\nG.4.7.1 Focal species and habitats of interest in the USSEA subregion\nThe USSEA subregion provides foraging, nesting and breeding habitat for all sea turtle species covered by the Plan. This subregion includes the majority of nesting on US Atlantic shorelines for loggerhead, green and leatherback turtles. Kemps ridley nesting effort on USSEA beaches is sporadic. Nesting and breeding in the USSEA region is significant for loggerhead and green turtle populations. In addition, offshore waters including the Gulf Stream is habitat for post-hatchling dispersal stage (lost years) loggerhead and green turtles (Mansfield et al., 2021; Mansfield et al., 2014) and may be habitat for leatherbacks as well. Sea turtles have a year-round presence in the waters of the USSEA subregion. Some loggerhead turtles overwinter south of Cape Hatteras in the northern portion of the sub-region (Mansfield et al., 2009). All species covered by the plan have been detected on distance sampling surveys conducted as part of the regional AMAPPS program as well as on other survey efforts used in addition to AMAPPS survey by a Navy abundance estimation effort (DiMatteo and Sparks, 2022; Palka et al., 2021).\n\n\nG.4.7.2 Potential effects of concern specific to the USSEA subregion\nThe potential effects of offshore wind development are similar in this subregion as are discussed in Section 2 of this chapter with the addition of nesting, breeding and hatching behavior to be considered. There are, however, no projects in this subregion currently under review by BOEM, and only two leases have been awarded off southern North Carolina. Development in this subregion is significantly lower and farther from completion than subregions to the north. This extended timeline to development will allow for projects in the subregion to benefit from research conducted in the more northern subregions, which will be important as this subregion has a higher turtle density, significant nesting and breeding habitat, and greater year-round occurrence of sea turtles that other subregions. Although different from OSW development, efforts to study impacts of oil and gas operation and decommissioning in the Gulf of Mexico in the wake of the Deep Water Horizon Spill in 2010 is adding to the body of knowledge about turtle presence and behavior in sub-tropical climates. As in Virginia and North Carolina, states are unlikely to have significant funds from powersharing and other agreements that states to the north are able to receive. As such, most research in this subregion will likely need to be fully federally funded.\n\n\nG.4.7.3 Recommended field data collection and analysis in the USSEA subregion\nThere are no Field Data Collection and Analysis recommendations specifically for the USSEA sub-region. Region-wide recommendations that include the USSEA region are included in section 4.1 of this chapter.\nRecommended non-field research by type of action. There are no Non-Field Data Collection and Analysis recommendations specifically for the USSEA sub-region. Region-wide recommendations that include the USSEA region are included in section 4.1 of this chapter."

    "section": "J.1 Seafloor habitat in the Atlantic region",
    "text": "J.1 Seafloor habitat in the Atlantic region\nBordering the most densely populated portion of the country, the U.S. Atlantic continental margin has been studied for well over a century and provides a general framework of knowledge for informing past and future studies (Emery, 1966; Uchupi, 1968a). In brief, the U.S. Atlantic continental margin, which includes the continental shelf, slope, and rise, canyons, and seamounts, encompasses about 2,500 km of coastline between Maine and Florida and an area of nearly 700,000 km2 (Emery, 1966) Figure J.1. The geologically passive nature of the Atlantic margin has allowed broad beds of thick sediment to accumulate along the U.S Atlantic coast, resulting in a relatively shallow and wide shelf that extends more than 200 km offshore in some areas. The shelf is deeply incised by submarine canyons, especially in the northern portion of the Atlantic region, most likely a consequence of the powerful runoff from melting continental ice sheets at the end of glacial periods (BOEM, 2023).\n\n\n\nFigure J.1: A geomorphological overview of the U.S. Atlantic coast, including base coastal zones (i.e., shelf, slope, and abyss) and specific seafloor features (i.e., canyons, seamounts, rises, and plateaus). The black dotted line overlapping the continental shelf border represents a 200 m bathymetric contour. Data from (Harris et al., 2014) and downloaded from www.bluehabitats.org.\n\n\nBased on surface morphology alone, the U.S. Atlantic continental margin can be divided into three distinct zones (Uchupi, 1968a) that broadly align with the five subregions identified in the RWSC Science Plan Figure J.2. These three distinct zones include the (1) Northern Zone from Nova Scotia to Nantucket Island, (2) Central Zone from Nantucket Island to Cape Hatteras, NC, and (3) Southern Zone from Cape Hatteras, NC to the Florida Keys. An overview of the seafloor topography, surficial sediments, and habitat types for each zone is provided in the following paragraphs.\n\n\n\nFigure J.2: High-level delineation of the RWSC Science Plan subregions and distinct zones (Uchupi, 1968b). From north to south, the five RWSC Science plan subregions include the Gulf of Maine, Southern New England, New York/New Jersey (NY/NJ) Bight, U.S. Central Atlantic, and U.S. Southeastern Atlantic (separated by dotted white lines). The three zones that are differentiated based on surface morphology include the Northern Zone (light blue), Central Zone (dark blue), and Southern Zone (light green). Note, the displayed delineations are general and designed to organize knowledge and recommendations into more manageable units along the U.S. Atlantic margin.\n\n\nThe Northern Zone ranges from Nova Scotia to Nantucket Island, MA and includes both the Gulf of Maine and Georges Bank. This zone aligns with the RWSC Gulf of Maine subregion. Despite their immediate proximity to one another, these two glacially derived topographic features are often described separately given their differing structure and sediments Figure J.3. The Gulf of Maine, for instance, is a semi-enclosed continental shelf sea (9-350 m depth) that is characterized by a system of deep basins, moraines, and rocky protrusions (Stevenson et al., 2014a). In contrast, Georges Bank, a shallow (3-150 m depth) and elongated (161 km wide by 322 km long) submarine plateau that gradually slopes from north to south with steep submarine canyons and seamounts on its southern edge. The Gulf of Maine’s unique physiographic structure lends to a variety of surficial sediments (e.g., bedrock, silty sand, mud), whereas Georges Bank is predominantly sandy with local interruptions of glacially deposited gravel and fine sediment (NOAA Fisheries, 2023; Stevenson et al., 2014b). Complex topography and unique oceanographic conditions in the Gulf of Maine and Georges Bank result in a high diversity of physical (e.g., rocky, sandy, muddy) and biogenic (e.g., seagrass, shellfish, and kelp beds, cold-water coral) habitat types across the two areas. A more thorough review of these habitat types is detailed in (Tyrell, 2005).\n\n\n\nFigure J.3: Topographic overview of the U.S. Atlantic continental margin within the identified Northern Zone, which includes the Gulf of Maine, Georges Bank, and other submarine features. The dotted white line represents the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ; 200 nautical mile limit). Vertical exaggeration of colored relief is approximately 5x. Data provided by The Nature Conservancy’s Northwest Atlantic Marine Ecoregional Assessment (Greene et al., 2010).\n\n\nThe Central Zone includes the continental shelf and slope waters between Nantucket Island, MA and Cape Hatteras, NC Figure J.4, encompassing features such as the Nantucket Shoals, Long Island Sound, Hudson Shelf Valley, and a series of canyons in deeper waters. The Central Zone overlaps three RWSC subregions: Southern New England, New York/New Jersey Bight, and U.S. Central Atlantic. This region is characterized by a uniform and broad expanse of gently sloping continental shelf that extends up to 150 km offshore (100-200 m depth) where it transitions to the slope at the shelf break. Similar to Georges Bank, numerous canyons incise the slope, some of which cut up onto the shelf itself, as it descends rapidly to 3,000 m (Stevenson et al., 2014c). Sand is the predominant surficial sediment type on the shelf with small, localized areas of sand-shell and sand-gravel. Fine sediments are also common on the shelf valleys leading to the submarine canyons as well as in areas off Southern New England, specifically the Mud Patch, where tidal currents slow significantly and allow silts and clays to settle out and mix with sand. Areas of hard bottom are associated with the canyons within the shelf slope/break. Although rocky substrate is otherwise rare in areas south of Long Island, man-made structures like shipwrecks and artificial reefs are frequent and provide important habitat to the southern Mid-Atlantic Bight ecosystem (Steimle and Zetlin, 2000; Stevenson et al., 2014d). The Mid-Atlantic Bight Cold Pool is a characteristic of the region, where strong seasonal stratification promotes productivity among all levels of the food chain; it is a dynamic feature that provides crucial habitat in the northeast shelf, particularly as a thermal refuge for benthic species (Blair et al., 2022).\n\n\n\nFigure J.4: Topographic overview of the U.S. Atlantic continental margin within the identified Central Zone. The dotted white line represents the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ; 200 nautical mile limit). Vertical exaggeration of colored relief is approximately 5x. Data provided by The Nature Conservancy’s Northwest Atlantic Marine Ecoregional Assessment (Greene et al., 2010).\n\n\nFinally, the Southern Zone extends southward from Cape Hatteras, NC to the Florida Keys Figure J.5 and aligns with the RWSC U.S. Southeast Atlantic subregion. The continental margin in the southeastern U.S. is unique in its overall dimensions and submarine features when compared to more northern regions. The shallow continental shelf in this region, for instance, is relatively wide to the north (100 km width) but contracts significantly as it approaches the Straits of Florida (11 km width) (Conley et al., 2017). In contrast to steep continental slopes, the slope in the southeastern U.S. is unusually wide and dominated by the Blake Plateau, a broad marginal plateau (184,000 km2 area; 400-1,250 m depth), which is flanked by the Florida-Hatteras Slope on its western margin and the Blake Escarpment on its southeastern margin (descending to about 4,800 m). Sand-shell sediments dominate the southwestern end of the continental shelf, whereas foraminiferal sands or silts characterize the top of Blake Plateau (Emery, 1966). Although no major canyons cut across the slope in this area, the Gulf Stream is and has been a dominant force shaping the seafloor, scouring steep channel along most of the southeast region and often exposing hard substrates that create rugged topography (Ross and Nizinski, 2007). Sandy habitats on the shelf sustain important fish species while rocky outcrops on the seafloor provide substrate for sponges, corals, and algae (Conley et al., 2017).\n\n\n\nFigure J.5: Topographic overview of the U.S. Atlantic continental margin within the identified Southern Zone. The dotted white line represents the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ; 200 nautical mile limit). Vertical exaggeration of colored relief is approximately 5x. Data provided by The Nature Conservancy’s South Atlantic Bight Marine Assessment (Conley et al., 2017).\n\n\n\nJ.1.1 Overlap with studies of fisheries and commercially managed fish species\nCommercially important and managed fish species, which are outside of the scope of this Science Plan, rely on seafloor habitats at several life history stages. For research needs and considerations on fisheries and managed fish species, visit the Responsible Offshore Science Alliance (ROSA). While both RWSC and ROSA are engaging in regional coordination and advancement of research and monitoring related to interactions between offshore wind and ecosystems, ROSA’s focus is fisheries (commercial and recreational) and RWSC’s focus is wildlife. Each organization exists because issues related to the intersection of offshore wind and fisheries often differ from those of wildlife and endangered species. To ensure close coordination on issues in the RWSC Science Plan that might relate with ROSA’s work, ROSA staff participate in the RWSC Habitat & Ecosystem Subcommittee and the Protected Fish Species Subcommittee.\n\n\nJ.1.2 Sensitive and critical habitats\nHard, immobile substrates provide a distinct and important habitat for numerous biota across a span of life stages. Besides providing stable attachment sites for sessile organisms, complex physical habitat is depended upon by many fish1 species to survive and reproduce, especially those that constitute economically valuable fisheries2 . Although traditional management has historically relied on statutes that dictate acceptable levels of fishing effort, a lack of essential habitat for these fishery species can negatively influence the health of marine ecosystems and the societies that depend on them .\nTherefore, to maintain productive fisheries and rebuild depleted fish stocks3 in the United States, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Marine Fisheries Service (i.e., NOAA Fisheries) requires the identification and protection of fish habitat that may be adversely impacted by coastal development and other human activities. This insertion of essential fish habitat (EFH), or those waters and substrates necessary to fish for spawning, breeding, feeding, or growth to maturity (NOAA Fisheries, 1993), under the Magnuson Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson-Steven Act), allows regional fishery management councils to pinpoint and protect EFH by limiting certain activities, including fishing gear restrictions, changing catch allowances, or a combination of measures.\nTo increase scrutiny, study, or mitigation planning compared to other areas, EFH can be categorized into more distinct designations. Habitat Areas of Particular Concern (HAPC), for instance, are subsets of EFH that require higher priority in terms of conservation effort and can exhibit one or more of the following traits: rare, under stress from development, sensitive to decline, or support major ecological functions (NOAA, 2023b). Once a species is listed under the Endangered Species Act, NOAA Fisheries evaluates and identifies whether any areas meet the definition of Critical Habitat, i.e., specific areas that may require special management considerations or protection for the conservation of an endangered species (NOAA Fisheries, 2023). To date, NOAA has described EFH for approximately 1,000 managed species, and identified over 100 HAPCs throughout the U.S. Atlantic coast Figure J.6.\n\n\n\nFigure J.6: A screenshot of NOAA Fisheries’ Essential Fish Habitat Mapper displaying Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) and Habitat Areas of Particular Concern (HAPC) for federally managed species off the U.S. Atlantic coast. The online and interactive mapping tool can be found at the following hyperlink: https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/resource/map/essential-fish-habitat-mapper4.\n\n\nA considerable amount of physical and biological information is necessary when accurately mapping essential and critical habitat types, especially to meet requirements under the Magnuson-Stevens Act (NOAA Fisheries, 2021a). Benthic substrates and features, for instance, should be mapped using information collected from acoustic surveys and in-situ seafloor sampling (e.g.,sediment grain size analysis, imagery). Although it is important to delineate and characterize all habitat types in an area that may be adversely impacted by activities, structurally complex habitats are particularly important due to their numerous benefits to taxa (Kutti et al., 2015; Stevenson et al., 2014c). NOAA Fisheries defines complex habitats as (1) hard bottom substrates (e.g., gravels, gravel mixes, gravelly, and shell; Figure J.7), (2) hard bottom substrates with epifauna or macroalgae cover, and (3) vegetated habitats (e.g., submerged aquatic vegetation). Complex habitats can also include heterogeneous environments (e.g., mixes of soft and complex habitats) and man-made marine structures as they can provide equally valuable habitat and functionality for some managed species.\n\n\n\nFigure J.7: Examples of complex sediment types collected from sediment profile (A, C, D) and plan view (B) imaging. (A) displays infaunal, tube-building worms and an epifaunal echinoderm (i.e., sand dollar); (B) shows shell habitat with slipper shells, shell fragments and crab; (C) displays shell fragments and small crab utilizing substrate for cover; (D) displays gravel substrate with microalgal growth.\n\n\nIn addition to physical attributes, understanding benthic community composition is necessary for habitat classification purposes as infauna and epifauna can provide unique environmental and physical structure for other organisms (NOAA Fisheries, 2021b; Tyrell, 2005). Infauna, for example, support sediment health and stability and epifauna create hard bottom and other structurally complex habitat. Submerged aquatic vegetation, along with sequestering carbon and improving water quality, provides important habitat for numerous fish in terms of shelter from predators and food availability.\n\n\nJ.1.3 Potential effects with respect to offshore wind\nAll offshore wind development will have some interaction with the seafloor and potentially influence benthic habitats and associated biological communities. Although accustomed to naturally occurring environmental fluctuations and disturbances, the ecological function of seafloor habitats and benthic communities can be temporarily or permanently altered with the addition of offshore wind components. Shallow-water communities tend to be more resilient to disturbances, given the natural frequency of disturbances in these environments, whereas deep-water communities may be less resilient.\nGiven the contribution of benthic environments to ecosystem services globally (Dannheim et al., 2020), it is important to understand the effects of offshore wind development. The U.S. Offshore Wind Synthesis of Environmental Effects Research group has therefore provided an overview of stressors to benthic habitats and associated biological communities during pre-construction, construction, operations and maintenance, and decommission project phases (SEER, 2022a). This overview is by no means an exhaustive review but to simply illustrate the primary and secondary effects of offshore wind energy development to benthic environments to guide future research and mitigation efforts.\nPrimary effects:\n\nLoss of habitat: The installation of offshore wind components results in the loss of habitat, resulting in the mortality of sessile and relocation of more mobile organisms to new locations.\nConversion of habitat, introduction of new hard substrate: Wind turbine foundations, anchors, and scour protection can create new hard substrate. Despite altering the native benthic ecology of the area, these components create new hard substrate that is rapidly populated by benthic communities after installation.\nIntroduction of non-native species: The introduction of hard substrate can serve as stepping stones for non-native species to expand their range into new areas and outcompete native species.\nSeabed disturbance and recovery: The extent and overall impact of seabed disturbances from installing foundations and cables vary depending on local conditions, construction activity, and overall recovery.\nWater quality, sediment, and turbidity: Offshore wind component installation can suspend sediment into the surround water column and affect marine life (e.g., smother or burial of benthic sessile organisms, impair filtering for filtering animals, decrease visibility).\n\nOther considerations\n\nContaminant release from sediment and offshore components: The release of contaminants from re-suspended sediments during installation or anodes to prevent corrosion can be introduced into the food chain without proper siting.\nNoise and vibration: Although sensitive to noise and/or vibration during installation activities, benthic organisms are generally more likely to be impacted by the seabed disturbance caused by the physical installation activity itself. Persistent noise during wind farm operation, however, could affect benthic organisms and alter benthic ecological functions.\nEmissions from cable: Power flowing through inter-array and export cables generate heat (SEER, 2022a) and produce electromagnetic fields (SEER, 2022c), which may affect organism sensitive to those characteristics. Temperature increases and electromagnetic waves are naturally present in the benthic environment and occupy a limited spatial extent when originating from cables but could cause organisms to relocate or impair essential life functions.\n\n\n\nJ.1.4 Common data collection methods and approaches\nTo investigate questions about seafloor habitat, especially with respect to the potential concern of offshore wind development, this Science Plan describes commonly applied methodologies for data collection and research. The following categories of methods are used throughout this chapter for consistency, but the Subcommittee recognizes that different tools, technologies, and/or procedures could be implemented with respect to each specific chapter.\nMethods for data collection can be broadly grouped into (a) field and (b) non-field activities. Field activities include real-time observations via photo or video, sensor deployment, and extractive surveys. Synthesis and modeling are the most common types of non-field activities in this science plan. Below is a high-level overview of field and non-field activities used for mapping the seafloor and characterizing associated habitat, specifically a brief description of the general technique, data type, and instruments.\nField activities include:\n\nSeafloor acoustics: Rapid and non-invasive sonar techniques used to detect and map seafloor environments via the transmission and reception of acoustic pulses. Includes multi-beam echosounders (MBES) and side-scan sonar systems deployed from vessels, either mounted to the vessel itself or via a remote-operated vehicle (ROV), or using more sophisticated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV).\nSeafloor grabs: Collection technique that physically samples the seafloor and associated biota to ground-truth sediment types, sensitive habitats, and benthic community composition. Includes vessel- , ROV-, or diver-based grab samplers (i.e., Van Veen, Harmon, Smith McIntyre) that may influence the composition of the sample.\nSeafloor imagery: Optical technique for photographing or recording benthic geology and biology (e.g., seafloor surface, upper sediment column). Includes sediment profile imaging (SPI), plan view imaging (PV), drop cameras, and stationary or towed video (including via AUVs and ROVs).\nWater quality and oceanography: In-situ water property measurements, including measures of conductivity/temperature/depth profiles, nutrients, dissolved organic matter, suspended particles, and ocean currents.\n\nNon-field activities include:\n\nCoordination and planning: Coordination among the four RWSC sectors and the research community through the operation of the RWSC, but also other multisector coordination activities led by federal agencies and individual states; deconflicting research activities; coordination around an issue or species, such as the North Atlantic right whale.\nStandardizing data collection, analysis, and reporting: Development and maintenance of informal “best practices” as well as formal guidance from government entities on the specific protocols and methods that should be used for specific data types and/or studies to ensure alignment with advances in technologies and practices.\nHistorical data collection/compilation: Adding existing data to modern databases so that historical data can be used in long-term/time-series analyses and studies.\nStudy optimization: Implementation of statistical frameworks and analyses to determine optimal study designs given a set of data conditions and research goals.\nModel development and statistical framework: Development and maintenance of sediment models, habitat suitability models; predictive modeling of rare or critical habitat or presence of species of concern.\nTechnology advancement: Includes the development and testing of new field research tools/methods or mitigation options; can also include development of and improvements to data systems.\nMeta-analysis and literature review: Compilations of research priorities, impacts literature, assessments of data availability, and life history parameters to inform models.\nOutreach and platforms to provide data products and results to stakeholders: Includes the work that RWSC does to summarize and convey findings and results to stakeholders and decision makers, including through regional portals and other web-based platforms that display interpretive maps with exploratory tools and links to the underlying data as appropriate.\n\n\n\nJ.1.5 Online repositories of seafloor habitat information\nSeveral web-based tools provide the public with information about the seafloor habitat and associated benthic communities in the RWSC study area. \n\nJ.1.5.1 Raw data\nNCEI Bathymetric Data Viewer\nNOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) and the IHO Data Center for Digital Bathymetry (DCDB) archive and share depth data acquired by hydrographic, oceanographic, and industry vessels and platforms during surveys or while on passage. These data, which are used in several national and international mapping bathymetry projects, are free to the public with no restrictions via the NCEI Bathymetric Data Viewer (Figure 13). This interactive viewer allows for the identification of NOAA bathymetric data for both visualization and download. The viewer contains single-beam tracklines, multibeam surveys and mosaics for data visualization, the NOS hydrographic surveys, BAG footprints and shaded imagery, digital elevation models (DEMs), and coastal LiDAR datasets available. Despite the vast amount of publicly available seafloor mapping data, it should be noted that the NOAA-NCEI has strict submission guidelines which can potentially impact delivery of datasets online.\n\n\n\nFigure J.8: A screenshot of the Bathymetric Data Viewer, an online data portal and repository for bathymetric surveys hosted by NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI).\n\n\nNGDC (NCEI) Seafloor Sediment Grain Size Database\nThe NGDC (now NCEI) Seafloor Sediment Grain Size Database contains particle size data for over 17,000 seafloor samples worldwide. The file was begun by NGDC in 1976 in response to a need by the Outer Continental Shelf Environmental Assessment Program (OCSEAP) for a detailed, digital file of textural analyses. Data are from OCSEAP studies, academic institutions, environmental baseline studies conducted under contract to the Bureau of Land Management under the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Program, and from laboratory reports generated by the U.S. Naval Oceanographic Office. It does not appear that data are continually/actively added to this database at this time.\nusSEABED\nThe usSEABED datasets currently hold georeferenced point data for more than 300,000 data sites in U.S. waters from the beach to the deep sea, rivers, lakes, and estuaries. In usSEABED, existing data from the USGS and other research groups are processed and extended to maximize their density and usability creating unified, comprehensive, relationally linked datasets for mapping and analysis.  Source data include surficial and subbottom data from physical sampling equipment (grabs and cores) and virtual sampling such as descriptions from seafloor photographs and videos.\n\n\nJ.1.5.2 Data products\nData products include maps of bathymetry, sediment type, and seafloor habitat type. They are typically interpreted from several sources of raw data. The following platforms and tools provide public access to seafloor data products:\nBlueTopo\nBlueTopo is a compilation of the nation’s best available bathymetric data. Created as part of the NOAA Office of Coast Survey nautical charting mission and its National Bathymetric Source project, BlueTopo is curated bathymetric source data to provide a definitive nationwide model of the seafloor and the Great Lakes. Blue Topo is still under development for many parts of the nation, but much of U.S. Atlantic waters have been completed. BlueTopo will soon be available to view and access as a web service through nowCOAST™. BlueTopo is available through NOAA’s Big Data Program.\nMarine Cadastre National Viewer\nWith over 300 data layers from numerous sources, MarineCadastre.gov is one of the premier sources for authoritative ocean data and tools. A cooperative effort between the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), MarineCadastre.gov works closely with national, regional, and state partners to develop and provide direct access to the best-available data and tools to meet the growing needs of the blue economy. The MarineCadastre.gov web-based viewer, the National Viewer, provides the baseline information needed for ocean planning efforts, particularly those that involve finding the best location for renewable energy projects. The viewer is also a helpful tool for the permit review process. View jurisdictional boundaries, restricted areas, applicable laws, critical habitat locations, and other important features within a selected ocean area. Use these data to identify potential conflicts early in the planning process.\nNortheast Ocean Data Portal\nEstablished in 2009, the Northeast Ocean Data Portal provides free, user-friendly access to expert-reviewed interactive maps and data on the ocean ecosystem, economy, and culture of the northeastern United States. The Portal’s maps show the richness and diversity of the ecosystem and illustrate the many ways that humans and environmental resources interact. Portal users can view maps and data by theme, by creating custom maps in the Data Explorer, and by downloading data for use in other applications.\nThe Portal was developed and is maintained by the Northeast Regional Ocean Council (NROC), but many organizations contribute. Data providers include state and federal agencies, scientists, ocean industries, non-government organizations, and other entities. All of these groups, plus a variety of stakeholders, review Portal data and advise on data presentation and visualization. A core team, the Northeast Ocean Data Working Group, maintains and updates the Portal’s databases, maps, and website. The Northeast Ocean Data Working Group includes the Northeast Regional Ocean Council, NOAA Office for Coastal Management, Northeastern Regional Association of Coastal Ocean Observing Systems (NERACOOS), RPS, The Nature Conservancy, and Waterview Consulting.\nMid-Atlantic Ocean Data Portal\nWith competing demands on our oceans at an all-time high, finding ways to engage all stakeholders in coastal and marine planning has never been more important. The Mid-Atlantic Regional Council on the Ocean (MARCO) recognizes that a robust ocean data and information management system that includes a wide range of human use, environmental, socioeconomic and regulatory data will provide the building blocks for multi-use, regional-scale ocean planning.\nThe Mid-Atlantic Ocean Data Portal is an online toolkit and resource center that consolidates available data and enables state, federal and local users to visualize and analyze ocean resources and human use information such as fishing grounds, recreational areas, shipping lanes, habitat areas, and energy sites, among others. The Portal serves as a platform to engage all stakeholders in ocean planning from the five-state Mid-Atlantic region—putting essential data and state-of-the-art mapping and visualization technology into the hands of the agencies, industry, and community leaders. The Portal is maintained by a team consisting of the Monmouth University Urban Coast Institute, Ecotrust, The Nature Conservancy and Rutgers University’s Center for Remote Sensing and Spatial Analysis under the guidance of MARCO. It was developed with grant support from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)."

The Subcommittee will meet regularly to share information and track Science Plan progress.\nThe National Ocean Mapping, Exploration, and Characterization Council (NOMEC):The National Ocean Mapping, Exploration, and Characterization Council was formed in June 2020 to coordinate agency policy and actions needed to advance ocean mapping, exploration, and characterization, and to support collaboration with non-governmental partners and stakeholders as well as government-to-government collaborations with Tribal Nations. The Council works to develop and implement multi-disciplinary, collaborative, and coordinated approaches to mapping, exploring, and characterizing the United States EEZ. The Council reports to the Ocean Science and Technology Subcommittee, which provides support and guidance for the Council’s work as appropriate.

(SeaSketch: https://legacy.seasketch.org/#projecthomepage/5272840f6ec5f42d210016e4/about)\nIWG Ocean Exploration and Characterization (IWG-OEC) - The IWG-OEC was created in 2020 and, with oversight from the NOMEC Council, will recommend and facilitate exploration and characterization efforts that provide needed information and insights about deep-water (&gt;40 m) environments, including the seafloor, sub-bottom, and water column, from exploratory initial assessments to comprehensive characterization in direct support of specific research, resource management/stewardship, policymaking, or other mission objectives\n\nBOEM’s Environmental Studies Program:BOEM’s Environmental Studies Program (ESP) develops, funds, and manages rigorous scientific research specifically to inform policy decisions on the development of energy and mineral resources on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). Mandated by Section 20 of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, the ESP is an indispensable requirement informing how BOEM manages offshore oil and gas, offshore renewable energy, and the marine minerals program for coastal restoration. The ESP has provided over $1 billion for research since its inception in 1973. Research covers physical oceanography, atmospheric sciences, biology, protected species, social sciences and economics, submerged cultural resources, environmental fates and effects, oil spills, and more.\nAtlantic Seafloor Partnership for Integrated Research and Exploration (ASPIRE): The Atlantic Seafloor Partnership for Integrated Research and Exploration, or ASPIRE, is a major multi-year, multi-national collaborative ocean exploration field program focused on raising collective knowledge and understanding of the North Atlantic Ocean. The campaign will provide data to inform and support research planning and management decisions in the region. NOAA’s ASPIRE campaign will broaden both the geographic focus to include more of the U.S. Atlantic and the high seas and the scope of partnerships to include federal agencies, such as the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management and the U.S. Geological Survey, as well as international partners from the European Union and Canada. Initial ASPIRE fieldwork was conducted in 2016 and 2017, and NOAA Ship Okeanos Explorer will join partners in operating in the region again from 2018 to 2022.\nThe Northeast Regional Ocean Council: Formed in 2005, the Northeast Regional Ocean Council (NROC) is a state and federal partnership that facilitates the New England states, federal agencies, regional organizations, and other interested regional groups in addressing ocean and coastal issues that benefit from a regional response. NROC facilitates the development of coordinated and collaborative responses to coastal and ocean management issues that benefit from regional solutions. NROC conducts most of its work through three Committees focused on advancing regional priorities, including:\n\nThe Ocean Planning Committee: The Ocean Planning Committee (OPC) was established to inform and recommend to the Council how best to approach regional issues and coordinate activities related to ocean planning in New England. The OPC works on regional efforts to improve the coordinated management of commercial and recreational uses of the ocean. The Committee’s activities focus on engaging stakeholders and the user community, providing data and tools for ocean planning, and identifying approaches for developing and implementing a regional ocean plan.\nThe Ocean and Costal Ecosystem Health Committee: The Ocean and Coastal Ecosystem Health Committee (OCEH) was established to help identify and coordinate regional activities to preserve and restore ecosystem health in New England. The OCEH is working to ensure that the importance of ocean and coastal ecosystem health is recognized as critical to the long-term sustainability of our region and that all levels of government have access to and utilize comprehensive information to manage ocean and coastal resources.\n\nThe Mid-Atlantic Regional Council on the Ocean: In 2008 the Coastal Zone Management Programs of New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland and Virginia began discussing the need for a regional approach to managing the Mid-Atlantic’s ocean resources and uses. After developing a white paper and crafting an agreement to work together, in June 2009, the governors of these five states signed a Mid-Atlantic Regional Ocean Conservation Agreement and created the Mid-Atlantic Regional Council on the Ocean (MARCO). MARCO and MACO collaborate with governmental agencies, tribal nations and many other interested stakeholders through a series of specially focused work groups.\nNorth Atlantic Regional Team (NART):NOAA’s North Atlantic Regional Collaboration Team currently focuses on two topical areas: Climate & Watersheds and Coastal & Ocean Uses. This includes NOAA collaboration on habitat restoration, working waterfronts, offshore wind, and aquaculture, as well as climate and ecosystem monitoring and community resilience. Engagement and a functional focus on diversity, equity and inclusion round out our current priorities. The NART works towards a singular goal: that North Atlantic communities are healthier and more resilient to a changing environment as a result of our work. The team shares local and regional knowledge; solicits/gathers stakeholder needs; provides support for place-based efforts (e.g. NOAA Habitat Focus Areas); matches partners with NOAA funding sources/grant opportunities and NOAA technical assistance; and ensures NOAA tools are available, integrated and consistent.\nSoutheast and Caribbean Regional Team (SEACART): To improve NOAA’s responsiveness to challenges and priorities of this region, the NOAA Southeast and Caribbean Regional Team (SECART) fosters stronger collaborative ties internally and with partners and constituents; works with constituents to evaluate and improve NOAA products and services; and promotes awareness and understanding of NOAA’s regional capabilities, services, and priorities. SECART is one of eight teams in NOAA’s Regional Collaboration Network. Team members reflect the capabilities of NOAA within the Southeast and U.S. Caribbean and include NOAA employees and NOAA partners.\nMaine Offshore Wind Research Consortium:In 2021, the governor and legislature in Maine established the Maine Offshore Wind Research Consortium to better understand the local and regional impacts of floating offshore wind power projects in the Gulf of Maine. The statute directs the Governor’s Energy Office (GEO) to serve as the coordinating agency and outlines an Advisory Board with representation from fisheries interests, and the Department of Marine Resources (DMR) and including other state agencies and stakeholders. The Advisory Board is responsible for establishing a research strategy that at a minimum includes the following themes: Opportunities and challenges caused by the deployment of floating offshore wind projects to the existing uses of the Gulf of Maine; Methods to avoid and minimize the impact of floating offshore wind projects on ecosystems and existing uses of the Gulf of Maine; and ways to realize cost efficiencies in the commercialization of floating offshore wind projects. The Maine Offshore Wind Consortium will collaborate closely with other states and regional and national science and research partners, including the National Offshore Wind Research and Development Consortium, and the Regional Wildlife Science Collaborative, of which the Governor’s Energy Office is a member.\nMassachusetts Habitat Working Group on Offshore Wind Energy:To augment the BOEM Intergovernmental Task Force process and engage directly with key stakeholders, the Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs and the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center (CEC) convenes two working groups for marine habitat and fisheries issues. While the working groups are voluntary and informal, they provide a critically important forum for maintaining a dialogue with key stakeholders, getting their feedback and guidance, and identifying issues and concerns. Input from the working groups has directly resulted in accommodations to avoid important marine habitat, fishing grounds, and marine commerce routes in the designation of the wind energy lease areas. The working groups will continue to provide valuable advice as leaseholders proceed through the next phases of the BOEM wind energy commercial leasing process, including site assessments, environmental and technical reviews, and development of construction and operations plans. The Habitat Working Group on Offshore Wind Energy is comprised of scientists and technical experts from environmental organizations, academia, and state and federal agencies.\nThe Massachusetts Office of Coastal Zone Management’s Seafloor and Habitat Mapping Program: CZM collects data and develops maps showing the distribution and diversity of seafloor habitats. Among other applications, this information is used by resource managers and project proponents to help avoid or minimize impacts when siting projects in Massachusetts ocean waters. Major components of CZM’s Seafloor and Habitat Mapping Program include sediment mapping, geoform mapping, biological mapping, and water column mapping. In 2003, CZM also initiated a Seafloor Mapping Cooperative with the USGS Woods Hole Science Center to jointly address the need for data and information characterizing seafloor resources. The goal of the cooperative is to comprehensively map the bathymetry (water depth) and geology of the seafloor inside the 3-nautical-mile limit of Massachusetts waters and in adjacent federal waters. As of 2012, the cooperative has mapped 2,200 square kilometers of Massachusetts marine waters and has published or is preparing to release these data as USGS Open-File Reports and Data Releases.\nThe Long Island Sound Habitat Mapping Initiative: The Long Island Sound Habitat Mapping Initiative is a federal, state and academic partnership that is applying some of the most advanced technologies available today to develop data and map products to guide decisions to better manage the Sound. Funded by the Long Island Sound Cable Fund and administered by the Long Island Sound Study the initiative is in the second of three phases focusing on areas selected by managers and scientists as high priority areas for habitat mapping. This web site provides information on the background and motivation for the mapping initiative, updates on the field activities conducted to date, interpretive story maps describing some of the results to date and multimedia links to images and video of the beauty and complexity of Sound.\nNYSERDA Environmental Technical Working Group:The 2018 Offshore Wind Master Plan for New York included the development of collaborative, science-focused Technical Working Groups to advise the State about offshore wind energy development. As defined in the Plan, the Environmental Technical Working Group (E-TWG) advises the State about “measures to avoid, minimize, and mitigate anticipated impacts on wildlife during offshore wind energy development activities,” including: Development of wildlife best management practices; Identification of research needs and coordination; Multi-agency coordination for adaptive management; Creation of a framework for an environmental conservation fund. The E-TWG meets up to four times annually. New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) and other state agencies provide the E-TWG with oversight and direction, and use group recommendations and discussions to inform decision making.\nNew Jersey Research & Monitoring Initiative:The Research and Monitoring Initiative (RMI) addresses the need for regional research and monitoring of marine and coastal resources during offshore wind development, construction, operation and decommissioning as recommended in the New Jersey Offshore Wind Strategic Plan. Initial funding is provided by developers through New Jersey’s Offshore Wind Solicitation 2. The RMI is administered by the NJ Department of Environmental Protection in collaboration with the NJ Board of Public Utilities. The goal of the RMI is ensure that New Jersey adheres to the mandate to protect and responsibly manage its coastal and marine resources as it moves towards a clean energy economy.\n\n\nJ.2.2 Field data collection and analysis\nThe following activities and data sources should be considered when planning new field data collection activities and leveraged for any planned analyses:\n\nReal-time Opportunity for Development Environmental Observations (RODEO)\nReal-time Opportunity for Development Environmental Observations (RODEO) II\nSediments and the Sea Floor of the Continental Shelves and Coastal Waters of the United States—About the usSEABED Integrated Sea-Floor-Characterization Database, Built With the dbSEABED Processing System\nMaine Coastal Program’s Mapping Initiative\nMassachusetts Office of Coastal Zone Management Seafloor and Habitat Mapping Program\nGulf of Maine Fish and Invertebrate Benthic Habitat Baseline Data Collection\nEnvironmental Monitors on Lobster Traps and Large Trawlers (eMOLT)\nDeep SEARCH: Deep Sea Exploration and Research of Coral/Canyon/Seep Habitats\nNortheastern U.S. Bathymetry and Backscatter Compilation: Western Gulf of Maine, Southern New England and Long Island\nNorthwest Atlantic Marine Ecoregional Assessment (NAM ERA)\nHabitat Mapping and Assessment of Northeast Wind Energy Areas\nEssential Fish Habitat Assessment and Consultation (NOAA Fisheries)\nStandard Approaches to Synthesizing, Visualizing, and Disseminating High-Resolution Geophysical Data to Advance Benthic Habitat Mapping in the Wind Energy Areas of the Northeast\nSediment-borne Wave Disturbances and Propagation and Potential Effects on Benthic Fauna\nNew York Bight Fish, Fisheries, and Sand Features: Data Review\nShelf Research Fleet\nComprehensive Seafloor Substrate Mapping and Model Validation in the Atlantic\nNew York State Offshore Wind Master Plan Analysis of Mulitbeam Echo Sounder and Benthic Survey DataNew York State Offshore Wind Master Plan Environmental Sensitivity Analysis\nNew York State Offshore Wind Master Plan Sand and Gravel Resources Study\nData Synthesis and Advanced Predictive Modeling of Deep Coral and Hardbottom Habitats in the Southeast Atlantic: Guiding Efficient Discovery and Protection of Sensitive Benthic Areas\nSoutheast Area Monitoring and Assessment Program (SEAMAP)\nBenthic Habitat Mapping and Assessment in the Wilmington-East Wind Energy Call Area\nThe Southeast Marine Mapping Tool (Phase 2): Increasing access to regional ecological data to help inform offshore ocean use decisions: Analysis and Visualization of Ocean Resources in the Context of Offshore Wind Energy Development\n\n\n\nJ.2.3 Data collection within lease areas\nSeafloor data collection is funded and implemented by multiple entities that participate in RWSC. Ongoing and pending activities are captured in the RWSC Offshore Wind & Wildlife Research Database.  For offshore wind companies, geophysical site characterization activities (i.e., seafloor mapping and data collection) inform multiple aspects of project development including engineering and risk assessment. Overall, the precise types of field data collection, processing, and analysis activities conducted by offshore wind companies are not well-known or consistent with respect to spatial coverage, applied methods, and sampled parameters. Geophysical site assessment information is often redacted in Construction and Operations Plans (COPs) posted to BOEM’s website. From a review of publicly available COPs, seafloor acoustic, imagery, and grab methods are often not applied consistently, and the footprints of investigations vary from within the wind lease area and along proposed export cable paths to land, only areas with proposed wind turbine generator locations, and, in some cases, areas beyond the lease area’s boundaries. This Subcommittee will lead the collaborative development of recommendations for improving the standardization of site assessment seafloor data collection and dissemination across offshore wind projects. \nSee below for a list of Benthic Habitat Characterization and Site Investigations available from Construction and Operating Plan for federal renewable energy development on the Outer

    "section": "J.3 Research topics: Seafloor habitat and offshore wind in the U.S. Atlantic Ocean",
    "text": "J.3 Research topics: Seafloor habitat and offshore wind in the U.S. Atlantic Ocean\nThis section presents recommendations within categories of Data Management, Data Collection, and Data Analysis activities. The Subcommittee also organized research topics by RWSC Research Themes in a table at the end of this section.. For each stated topic, there are potentially many detailed related questions, hypotheses, and potential approaches that could be used to address each. Presented research topics were synthesized from multiple existing sources of data gaps and research needs relevant to offshore wind energy development on the U.S. Atlantic coast (Degraer et al., 2021; Regional Synthesis Workgroup of the Environmental Technical Working Group, n.d.; SEER, 2022d). Given the potential number of studies to evaluate over the RWSC study area, the data search was restricted to seafloor-related studies and monitoring programs that were conducted in wind energy areas since 2010.\n\nJ.3.1 Data Management\nUnderstanding physical and biological seafloor habitats and processes near offshore wind developments will require close coordination among researchers, state and federal agencies, and industry.\nThe Habitat & Ecosystem Subcommittee recommends that consistent data collection methods are applied across studies so that data can support regional-scale assessments and the development and maintenance of regional data products and tools (e.g., species distribution models).\nTo support these efforts, the Subcommittee recommends:\n\nMaintenance of an up-to-date resource list of recommended repositories, data and metadata standards, guidance, and protocols for use by all data collectors. The current recommended resources are detailed in the table at the end of this section.\nDevelopment of standard language for inclusion in requests for proposals and funding agreements to encourage or require the use of recommended resources.\nIdentification of timelines around geophysical and sediment data sharing that consider protection of confidential business information and potential benefits to industry and other stakeholders from improving regional seafloor/habitat data products.\nNOAA NCEI is the only active U.S. repository that accepts and stores geophysical and seafloor data and metadata. NCEI should consider streamlining the appraisal and approval process for incorporating data collected in wind energy areas that are funded by entities other than NOAA to ensure that data collection funded by states, offshore wind developers, and other federal agencies can be quickly and efficiently stored at NCEI. This is especially important for the following types of data, for which no similar alternative repository was identified:\n\nDeep sea coral observations\nMarine trackline geophysical data (single beam bathymetry, subbottom profiles, magnetic, gravity, side scan sonar)\nOther hydrographic data (multibeam bathymetry, National Ocean Service hydrographic data, water column sonar data)\nMarine geology data(surficial sediment grain size and other seabed data)\n\nIn the absence of an expansion to an existing repository, new online platform(s) must be established to allow submission of and access to non-federal high-resolution seafloor mapping data, data products, and metadata (i.e., multibeam bathymetry and backscatter, side-scan sonar, geoform and substrate maps/data products).\nEstablishment of a publicly available database/portal of coordinates and maps of boulder relocations associated with offshore wind development.\nAdvance the recommendations for seafloor data formatting and sharing developed via the NROC/INSPIRE regional seafloor modeling project (funded by BOEM, Massachusetts Clean Energy Center, and Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management), specifically:\n\nTable 8. Recommended seafloor variables, file formats and resolutions to support the development of regional scale seafloor data products.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeafloor variable(s)\nType/format\nDesired resolution\n\n\nMultibeam bathymetry\nRaster/tiff\n4m*\n\n\nMultibeam backscatter\nRaster/tiff\n4m*\n\n\nBoulder fields and/or picks (identification of boulder locations)\nVector-points/polygons Esri shapefile\nN/A\n\n\nSeabed interpretation – CMECS Substrate Group, Subgroup\nVector-points/polygons/Esri shapefile\nN/A\n\n\nSeabed interpretation – Shell substrate\nVector-points/polygons/Esri shapefile\nN/A\n\n\nSeabed interpretation – Bedforms\nVector-polygons/Esri shapefile\nN/A\n\n\nSeabed interpretation – CMECS Biotic Subclass\nVector-points/Esri shapefile\nN/A\n\n\n\n*Bathymetry and backscatter data sets may be provided at high resolutions and will be down-sampled to the desired 4 meter resolution by the project team; alternatively, down-sampling instructions will be provided to data providers to ensure consistent methodology.\nThe following table lists the existing repositories and standards that are recommended for use in seafloor habitat data collection and identifies data types for which no or limited data management capacity (i.e., standard repositories and guidance) currently exists. \nTable 9. Recommended repositories and standards for seafloor data collection.\n\n\n\nMethod(s) and data type(s)\nRepository\nExisting Standards\n\n\nMarine trackline geophysical data, other hydrographic data, marine geology data, deep sea coral observations\nNOAA National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI)\nData collected without NOAA funding or support must go through a scientific appraisal process to be considered for the archive and is subject to the NESDIS non-NOAA data policy upon approval.\nISO 19115 XML Metadata standard is required by NCEI and the U.S. Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS).\n(Draft) Standard Ocean Mapping Protocol, Interagency Working Group on Ocean and Coastal Mapping for the National Ocean Mapping, Exploration, and Characterization Council\nCoastal and Marine Ecological Classification Standard (CMECS)\n\n\nGeophysical data; benthic habitat data\n\nBOEM guidelines for providing geophysical, geotechnical, and geohazard information\nGuidelines for providing benthic habitat survey information for renewable energy development on the Atlantic OCS\nNOAA Fisheries information needs to assess Essential Fish Habitat impacts from offshore wind energy projects along the U.S. Atlantic\nNOAA Fisheries Technical Guidance for Offshore Wind Energy Projects in the Greater Atlantic Region\n\n\nSurficial sediment characterizations from sediment grabs and imagery\nusSEABED\nThis resource is not accepting new data.\n\n\nBathymetry map products, seafloor habitat map products, sediment data map products\nMarine Cadastre National Viewer\nNortheast Ocean Data Portal\nMid-Atlantic Ocean Data Portal\nCoastal and Marine Ecological Classification Standard (CMECS)\n\n\nBoulder relocations\nNone – needs development\nNone – needs development\n\n\n\n\n\nJ.3.2 Data Collection\nSeafloor data collection is funded and implemented by multiple entities that participate in RWSC. Ongoing and planned activities are captured in the Offshore Wind & Wildlife Research Database.  For offshore wind companies, geophysical site characterization activities (i.e., seafloor mapping and data collection) inform multiple aspects of project development including engineering and risk assessment. Overall, the precise types of field data collection, processing, and analysis activities conducted by offshore wind companies are not well-known or consistent with respect to spatial coverage, applied methods, and sampled parameters. Geophysical site assessment information is often redacted in Construction and Operations Plans (COPs) posted to BOEM’s website. From a review of publicly available COPs, seafloor acoustic, imagery, and grab methods are often not applied consistently, and the footprints of investigations vary from within the wind lease area and along proposed export cable paths to land, only areas with proposed wind turbine generator locations, and, in some cases, areas beyond the lease area’s boundaries. This Subcommittee will lead the collaborative development of recommendations for improving the standardization of site assessment seafloor data collection and dissemination across offshore wind projects.\nAside from data collected by commercial entities, the Subcommittee will coordinate with and leverage existing and ongoing efforts by multiple groups to identify geographic data gaps in high-resolution seafloor mapping data (U.S. Interagency Working Group on Ocean and Coastal Mapping; National Ocean Mapping, Exploration, and Characterization Council (NOMEC); Northeast Regional Ocean Council Habitat Classification and Ocean Mapping Subcommittee). These groups produce regular updates to data gaps assessments and publish map products that help guide new data collection. A current map showing survey coverage of digital soundings data (i.e., seafloor acoustic data) is available via the NCEI Bathymetric Data Viewer. In consideration of this information and evolving prioritizations, the Subcommittee recommends general areas where new seafloor data collection is needed:\n\nOutside the boundaries of offshore wind leases throughout the RWSC study area.\nContinental shelf waters further from shore, including central and eastern Gulf of Maine and offshore Southern New England waters.\nWaters off the shelf near the BOEM Central Atlantic Planning areas.\n\nThe Subcommittee also recommends the following activities:\n\nDevelop recommended practices for consistent post-construction benthic monitoring to ensure regional compatibility of site-specific data:\n\nStatistical frameworks to guide sampling design, including the spatial and temporal extents over which effects can be detected.\nFrequency of sampling, including adaptive sampling after storms or other acute disturbances (e.g., nearby construction activity).\nConsistent methods to identify appropriate reference locations and to define “recovery from disturbance.”\nBenthic community variables, ecological functions, and processes of interest (e.g., spawning, larval habitat, recruitment, feeding, growth).\n\nMonitor the transport, occurrence, and prevalence of non-native and invasive species on/via offshore wind infrastructure.\nCharacterize biological colonization (i.e., sessile, attached, and epiphytic flora and fauna) of new structures, the marine communities they attract and support, and any associated biogeochemical changes to the surrounding environment (e.g., nutrient enrichment, carbon burial).\nPeriodically re-evaluate and standardize data collection and field methods to ensure collected data are suitable for regional needs.\nAdvance, evaluate, and apply new technologies and techniques to support seafloor data collection and habitat mapping analyses:\n\nAutonomous seafloor mapping platforms.\nNon-extractive sampling techniques (e.g., imagery, video, eDNA).\nArtificial intelligence for image classification (e.g., NOAA NCCOS Enhancing Habitat Mapping Accuracy and Efficiency Using Artificial Intelligence).\n\n\nIn the Gulf of Maine, there is almost no modern high-resolution seafloor data overlapping with the newly released draft Wind Energy Area. A few groups are working to address this (NOAA Deep Sea Coral Research and Technology Program, Northeast Regional Ocean Council Habitat Classification and Ocean Mapping Subcommittee), but additional geophysical and seafloor sampling data should be collected to establish baseline seafloor habitat characterizations.\nOf the active offshore wind leases in Southern New England and the New York/New Jersey Bight, several publicly available COPs provide information about seafloor data collection. Collaborative work with respect to developing data sharing workflows and recommendations for standardization should leverage this available information as a case study. Lessons learned from the data collection and monitoring of the Block Island Wind Farm should be applied here. With construction ongoing in these subregions, studies should seek to characterize the effects of construction activities on seafloor environments and benthic communities, the colonization of new structures, and how far any effects are felt from these activities (spatially and temporally).\nLessons learned from the seafloor data collection and monitoring of the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind Pilot project should be applied to studies in the U.S. Central Atlantic. Data collection outside the active leases in the area is needed, as most active projects are currently focused in lease areas.\nThere are limited field data collection activities occurring in the U.S. Southeast Atlantic and no publicly available COPs for offshore wind projects.\n\n\nJ.3.3 Data Analysis\nData analyses should provide the environmental context and potential drivers of any changes observed in wildlife, seek to assess whether offshore wind is causing any observed changes, evaluate the efficacy of monitoring and mitigation strategies, and inform where new data collection is needed. The Subcommittee is especially interested in studies that seek to distinguish between climate change-driven shifts in seafloor/benthic community composition and processes and changes that may be driven by offshore wind construction and operation. Analyses and studies should:\n\nLeverage seafloor data collected by multiple entities and purposes, including for ongoing NOAA chart development, federal and state resource assessments, offshore wind Site Assessment Plans, Construction and Operation Plan development, and other purposes that can be appropriately down-sampled (if necessary) and shared with the RWSC Habitat & Ecosystem Subcommittee via publicly accessible repository for inclusion in regional-scale habitat data products in a timely fashion.\nDevelop consistent regional-scale seafloor habitat maps that leverage existing and new data and that are reproducible:\n\nMap seafloor habitat variables that are needed for megafauna species distribution modeling.\nMap geoforms, substrates, and biotic assemblages using the Coastal and Marine Ecological Classification Standard (CMECS).\nContinue to update products with new geophysical and ground-truth data every 3-5 years or as is practical.\nEvaluate model performance and use results to guide new data collection.\n\nIdentify sensitive seafloor habitats in the RWSC study area to inform offshore wind siting, permitting, and future assessments, including by advancing consistent methods for:\n\nHard bottom/substrate habitat modeling\nDeep sea coral and sponge habitat suitability modeling, led by NOAA NCCOS\nCoordination with the Responsible Offshore Science Alliance (ROSA) on applications to fisheries habitats and assessments\n\nStudy physical and ecological effects on seafloor habitat and benthic communities related to construction activities:\n\nEvaluate benthic community function and other relevant metrics both before and after the introduction of stressors.\nUnderstand impacts of noise and vibration to the growth, behavior, and survival of benthic species under controlled laboratory conditions.\nWork with other RWSC Subcommittees and partners characterizing soundscapes and evaluate effects on benthic communities.\nAssess the effects of cable laying activities (e.g., sediment suspension and deposition related to jet plowing) across various habitats and subregions.\nAssess the effects of seafloor preparation activities (e.g., jack-up barges, boulder relocation) across various habitats and subregions.\nCharacterize and compare the footprints of benthic disturbance between fixed and floating offshore wind developments.\nCharacterize benthic community recovery trajectories and times to recovery.\n\nStudy physical and ecological effects on seafloor habitat and benthic communities related to operation and maintenance activities:\n\nEvaluate benthic community function and other relevant metrics both before and after the introduction of stressors.\nUnderstand how benthic species detect and respond to EMF in terms of growth, behavior, and survival under controlled laboratory conditions.\nCharacterize any alteration of seafloor habitat conditions due to EMF, sediment temperature changes, vibration from turbines during normal operation and various contexts (e.g., different substrate types, burial depth, floating vs. fixed technology).\nEntrainment associated with high voltage direct current cooling systems.\nStudy potential effects on benthic-pelagic coupling and benthic habitat quality:\n\nAlterations to hydrodynamics, stratification, and mixing as potential drivers of benthic habitat/process change.\nEffects of increased organic matter on nutrient cycling and trophic linkages.\n\nExamine how the introduction of new hard structures alters the geochemical and biological composition and ecological processes within benthic habitats.\nAssess the cumulative/net effects of introduced structures on species richness, diversity, and ecosystem services in a consistent way across projects/sites.\n\nConduct assessments of construction approaches/methods meant to limit benthic disturbance and/or augment benthic habitats (e.g., use of jackets vs. piles):\n\nLeverage existing research and learnings from other ocean industries (e.g., oil and gas).\nDevelop standard metrics for assessing benthic disturbance.\nConduct comparative field studies using consistent methods."

Regional fishery management councils and NOAA Fisheries federally manage species that predominantly occur in ocean waters beyond the state jurisdictional limit (three nautical miles). The four regional fishery management councils responsible for managing most federal fisheries in the U.S. waters of the Atlantic Ocean include the New England Fishery Management Council (NEFMC), the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council (MAFMC), the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council (SAFMC), and the Caribbean Fishery Management Council (CFMC). These regional fishery management councils are responsible for developing federal fishery management plans, regulations, and designating Essential Fish Habitat (EFH), while NOAA Fisheries is responsible for approving and implementing those plans, regulations, or Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) designations. This is not the case for highly migratory species (HMS), which are managed through NOAA Fisheries Atlantic Highly Migratory Species Management Division within the Office of Sustainable Fisheries. This division develops the fisheries management plans (FMPs) and designates EFH for HMS within the FMPs and regulations. NOAA Fisheries and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) are the lead federal agencies for implementation of The Endangered Species Act (ESA), which provides a framework to conserve and protect endangered and threatened species and their habitats. Marine species that predominately occur in nearshore or estuarine waters are typically managed by the individual states, while the ASMFC oversees the management of fish species for which there is an interstate management plan. All federal and state agencies responsible for fishery management work in coordination with, and collect input from, other federal partners, state partners, tribal governments, academia, industry, and non-governmental organizations.\nThe Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) is responsible for managing the development of energy on the outer continental shelf. BOEM produces Environmental Impact Statements (EISs) or Environmental Assessments (EAs) under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) for each offshore wind project. These documents are intended to thoroughly assess the potential impacts on protected fish, both from the individual project, and cumulatively (to include potential impacts from offshore wind development and all other potentially impactful activities). BOEM is also required to complete an EFH Consultation under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSA) for all activities that may affect areas of designated habitat where federally managed fish spawn, breed, feed, or grow to maturity.\nFish distribution in a marine environment is influenced by a variety of factors and is known to vary seasonally and over time. Spatiotemporal distributions and migration corridors do not just vary by species, but also by contingent/population within a given species. Water temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen levels, food availability, habitat structure/substrate type, and harvest all play major roles in where species are found. As a whole, fish are sensitive to changes in the environment and thus are subject to the impacts of shifting ocean conditions. Climate change, among other anthropogenic stressors, has altered the distribution of many fish species, and is projected to continue to affect fish distribution (Hare et al., 2016; NOAA Fisheries and BOEM, 2022a). NOAA Fisheries conducted a climate vulnerability assessment on 82 fish and invertebrate species in the U.S. Northeast, and determined that of the fish studied, diadromous species exhibit the highest level of vulnerability to climate change induced environmental changes (Hare et al., 2016). Atlantic sturgeon, shortnose sturgeon, and Atlantic salmon are all diadromous protected fish species located in the RWSC study area.  Anthropogenic activity such as commercial and recreational fishing, coastal development, pollution, and climate change each contribute to habitat alterations, and thus changing fish distributions. Offshore wind development will spark additional changes to many aspects of the ecosystem, and is likely to hasten certain biological changes including fish distributions.   \nFor the purposes of this document, protected fish will include all species that are listed as Endangered, Threatened, petitioned, candidate, or proposed under the Endangered Species Act. Under the ESA, some species are broken up into Distinct Population Segments (DPS), which are defined as a vertebrate population or group of populations that is discrete from other populations of the species and significant in relation to the entire species. According to the ESA, it is prohibited to take each of these species, and all Federal departments and agencies must seek to protect and conserve listed species and their habitats (“Laws & policies,” n.d.). Fish species listed under ESA are already in a vulnerable state, so are at an even greater risk with respect to anthropogenic impacts and changes to the environment. Therefore, these protected fish species may also be more susceptible to effects from offshore wind development. The subcommittee notes that while this plan focuses on protected fish species, there is also concern about the impacts of offshore wind development on other, non-ESA Listed fish species that overlap with offshore wind development in the western Atlantic.\n\nH.1.1 Focal species and notable recent trends\nTable 1 lists the protected fish species in the RWSC Study area which are considered in this appendix.\nTable 1. Protected Fish species in the RWSC study area.

The Responsible Offshore Science Alliance (ROSA) is an organization analogous to RWSC that advances research and monitoring on the potential effects of offshore wind on fisheries in the RWSC study area. While both RWSC and ROSA are engaging in regional coordination and advancement of research and monitoring related to interactions between offshore wind and ecosystems, ROSA’s focus is fisheries (commercial and recreational) and RWSC’s focus is wildlife. Each organization exists because issues related to the intersection of offshore wind and fisheries often differ from those of wildlife and endangered species. The scope of the RWSC Science Plan does not include fisheries or commercially managed fish species. For research needs and considerations on those topics, visit ROSA. To ensure close coordination on issues in the RWSC Science Plan that might relate with ROSA’s work and avoid duplication of efforts, the RWSC Protected Fish Species Subcommittee includes members from ROSA leadership. The RWSC and ROSA have, and will continue to, work closely together to support research and monitoring of fish and offshore wind.\nIn addition to the federally administered ESA, each state/district compiles a species of concern list. Species of concern for each state may also be listed federally under the ESA. The following table includes state or district websites that feature marine fish species of concern. The Subcommittee wanted to note these species in the Appendix, though they are not included in the scope of the chapter and will not be fully assessed.\nTable 2.

Each species is sorted into one of nine groups: Not Evaluated, Data Deficient, Least Concern, Near Threatened, Vulnerable, Endangered, Critically Endangered, Extinct in the Wild or Extinct. IUCN Red List species are not covered further in this chapter.\nThe Subcommittee also discussed species that do not appear on any protected species list, but may be impacted by the development of offshore wind. One such group are HMS, including all tuna, swordfish, billfishes, and sharks. There are also prohibited fish in various fisheries, so while not explicitly protected, it can be illegal to target and harvest certain fish. A few additional species brought forth by the Subcommittee for their potential to be impacted by offshore wind are the Warsaw grouper (Epinephelus nigritus) and the speckled hind (Epinephelus drummondhayi), as well as all previously petitioned and listed species. Cusk (Brosme brosme) was very recently removed from the candidate listing, so was not listed under the ESA and does not appear in Table 1. However, this species may be impacted by offshore wind development, particularly in the Gulf of Maine, as its habitat is limited. These species were not included in the scope of this chapter as they are not currently listed under the ESA.\nThe subcommittee notes that while this plan focuses on ESA Listed fish, concern remains regarding the impacts of offshore wind development on other fish species that overlap with ongoing and planned offshore wind development activities in the western Atlantic. This list of Protected Fish Species in the RWSC Study area will be updated periodically as more research is conducted and more information becomes available.\n\nH.1.1.1 Atlantic Sturgeon\nAtlantic sturgeon are anadromous, meaning they hatch in freshwater, migrate to salt water as sub adults, and return to freshwater as adults to spawn. sturgeon distribution and abundance varies by season (Dunton et al., n.d.), and they are bottom feeders, mainly consuming benthic invertebrates and fish close to the seabed. Earlier reported observer catch data showed that Atlantic sturgeon bycatch mostly occurred closest to the coasts, particularly bay mouths and inlets, so likely preferred shallower water with sandy bottom (Stein, Andrew et al., 2004). Studies conducted in more recent years suggest that their habitat and distribution is likely more expansive, and that additional targeted research is needed to fully and accurately assess Atlantic sturgeon habitat (Ingram et al., 2019). Atlantic sturgeon in the New York Wind Energy Area were regularly detected, with peaks from November through January and nearly absent July through September (Ingram et al., 2019). In addition, detections of unique fish decreased with an increasing distance from shore, though they did spread throughout the entire study array. Environmental factors were also explored, and photoperiod was determined to be a consistent trigger for migration while river temperature and discharge were two additional local factors (Ingram et al., 2019). The near-shelf region of Maryland was found to be mainly a transit route for Atlantic sturgeon (Rothermel et al., 2020; Secor et al., 2020). They primarily occupied warmer bottom temperatures, and had the lowest detection rates in the late spring through early fall. Atlantic sturgeon were found to occur year round in the Delaware wind energy area, though abundance peaked in November and December (Haulsee et al., 2020). Distribution shifted seasonally within the WEA from shallower areas in the spring and summer to deeper waters in the fall and winter. Receivers were also deployed in the York River watershed, the Lower James River, the Elizabeth River, the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay, and along the Atlantic coast (Hager, C., 2019). These receivers detected sturgeon that were tagged from Maine to Georgia, illustrating that this species is highly migratory and occurs region wide. The Atlantic sturgeon’s distribution throughout the region and frequent detections within WEAs illustrates the need for further research and continued monitoring.\nIt was previously accepted that Atlantic sturgeon spawn only in the spring, though evidence of fall spawning was documented in the more southern river systems, specifically the Combahee and Edisto rivers, SC (Collins et al., 2000; Farrae et al., 2017), Roanoke River, NC (Smith et al., 2015), James River, VA (Balazik, Matthew et al., 2012; Balazik MT and Musick JA, 2015), and Marshy Hope Creek, MD (Secor et al., 2022). A dual spawning strategy was also described from research suggesting the spawning of two groups at two different times and locations in the James River, adding to the known species level variation (Balazik MT and Musick JA, 2015). A study conducted to inform spatial distribution models of sturgeon concluded that depth, day-of-year, sea surface temperature, and light absorption by seawater were the primary predictors of occurrence in the mid-Atlantic Bight (Breece, M.W. et al., 2018). This model can be implemented to reduce harmful interactions with sturgeon. Even with the increased number of research projects in recent years, the Atlantic sturgeon is still considered a data poor species (ASMFC, 2017). As such, Hager (Hager, C., 2019) indicated the need to expand the understanding of environmental variables that impact sturgeon distribution in order to effectively manage the species.\nThere are five DPSs of Atlantic sturgeon listed under the ESA. The Gulf of Maine DPS was listed as threatened in 2012, and the other four DPSs (Carolina, Chesapeake Bay, New York Bight, and South Atlantic) were all listed as Endangered. Hare, Jon & Morrison et al., (Hare et al., 2016) conducted a climate change vulnerability assessment for species on the Northeast U.S. Continental Shelf, and the Atlantic sturgeon received an Overall Vulnerability Rank of Very High with 99% certainty. This study focused on fish from the three DPSs in the northeast, and while not studied, sturgeon researchers in the southeast believe that the impacts identified will likely affect the southern DPSs as well (A. Herndon, personal communication). It is also possible that fish in the Carolina and South Atlantic DPSs have adaptations that make them less vulnerable to increasing temperatures because they already live in warmer climates, but this is uncertain (A. Herndon, personal communication).\nThe Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission conducts stock assessments on Atlantic sturgeon, the last of which was completed in 2017 (ASMFC, 2017). Population numbers declined greatly from high historical levels in part due to overfishing, of which the population has not yet recovered from (Hilton et al., 2016). The 2017 benchmark assessment concluded that the resource of Atlantic Sturgeon is depleted due to multiple contributing factors including incidental capture in fisheries, habitat loss, and ship strike. That being said, the assessment indicates a positive trend, or a slowly increasing population since 1998 (ASMFC, 2017). Entanglement in fishing gear continues to be a problem, even though Atlantic sturgeon are no longer legal to target. Dunton et al. (Dunton et al., 2015) conducted a study on Atlantic sturgeon bycatch in the New York waters, and using regional observer data found that the majority of bycatch occurred in aggregation areas in bottom trawls and sink gillnets. The large mesh sink gillnet fishery is a major source of bycatch, and as a result of findings and requirements put forth in a Biological Opinion, the Atlantic Sturgeon Bycatch Working Group developed an Action Plan to reduce sturgeon entanglement in the federal fishery by 2024 (NOAA Fisheries and BOEM, 2022b). Some area closures in existence for other species also benefit Atlantic sturgeon in areas of overlap. The Gulf of Maine Cod Protection Closures and the Large-Mesh Gillnet Mid Atlantic Seasonal closures are two examples, both of which likely provide protection for sturgeon moving to and from their marine habitat into freshwater.\nVessel strikes, EMFs, degraded water quality, noise, and changes in marine habitat may also negatively affect Atlantic sturgeon. There is growing concern about sturgeon vessel strikes especially within the Chesapeake and New York Bight DPSs. A study conducted by Fox et al., (Fox et al., 2020) found that the overall reporting rate of Atlantic sturgeon carcasses was 4.76%. This suggests that vessel strike rates are likely higher than previously thought, as most incidents of vessel strikes are not seen or reported. These impacts tend to be more severe in estuarine and freshwater habitats. Rivers all along the East Coast have been defined as critical habitat for Atlantic sturgeon and are shown below in Figure H.1.\n\n\n\nFigure H.1: Map of Atlantic Sturgeon Critical Habitat. Source: NOAA Fisheries: https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/resource/map/atlantic-sturgeon-critical-habitat-map-and-gis-data\n\n\nAtlantic sturgeon habitat use overlaps with many wind farm lease, planning, and cable areas (Frisk et al., 2019; Haulsee et al., 2020; Ingram et al., 2019; Rothermel et al., 2020) and so they are subject to all potential effects with respect to offshore wind discussed in section 1.2.\n\n\nH.1.1.2 Atlantic Salmon\nAtlantic salmon in the United States are at the southern extent of their range and are found at critically low abundance. Historic populations in southern New England are extirpated, with remnant populations protected under the ESA in Maine (USFWS and NOAA, 2009).\nAtlantic salmon are anadromous fish with life histories that involve a variety of habitats. They begin their lives in freshwater rivers, migrate through estuaries to saltwater, and return to freshwater to spawn (Fay, Clem and al., 2006). Restoration, monitoring and research efforts are longstanding within Maine’s coastal rivers, with continued expansion into estuaries and bays (Renkawitz and Sheehan, 2011; Sheehan et al., 2011; USASAC, n.d.). Atlantic salmon encounter many threats because they occupy a variety of habitats. Identifying these threats has been a priority in recent years with particular emphasis focused on the smolt life stage when fish migrate from fresh to salt water and endure a physiological transformation. Baseline telemetry studies in Maine have outlined migration dynamics (Hawkes, J. P. et al., 2017; Kocik, J. F. et al., 2009; Renkawitz and Sheehan, 2011) and set the stage for follow-up investigations. These efforts include quantifying impacts of dams (Holbrook, C. M. et al., 2011; Stevens et al., 2019; Stich et al., 2015), in addition to targeted management actions (Hawkes et al., 2013) to improve smolt survival into the Gulf of Maine.\nBeyond monitoring tagged salmon with telemetry in their natal rivers, research has expanded further into the marine environment. A partnership between NOAA and the University of Maine School of Marine Science began in 2005 by utilizing existing marine infrastructure to increase monitoring capabilities. This platforms of opportunity initiative began with oceanographic buoys, but has since expanded to lobster traps and drifters. These data improve our understanding of salmon migration, but also benefit researchers of other tagged animals (Goulette et al., 2021; Goulette GS et al., 2014). In addition to these data collections, the deployment of the Ocean Tracking Network Halifax Array off Halifax, Nova Scotia in 2008 expanded coverage of salmon migration. Information from this array has been used to model behaviors, timing and movements within the Gulf of Maine and beyond, which may be useful to managers (Byron et al., 2014; Moriarty et al., 2016).\nThe range of Atlantic salmon is mostly in the northern portion of the Gulf of Maine which currently does not overlap with any lease areas. However, BOEM has published the Gulf of Maine Call for Information and Nominations (Call) in the deeper waters of the Gulf for floating offshore wind. This Call is an early step in the regulatory process for commercial leasing of offshore wind. Atlantic salmon critical habitat has been defined in rivers all along the coast of Maine and is shown below in Figure H.2. The range of Atlantic salmon continues east to Canada, so collaboration with international organizations is needed.\n\n\n\nFigure H.2: Atlantic Salmon Critical Habitat. Source: NOAA Fisheries\n\n\nAtlantic salmon will likely overlap with all stages of offshore wind development in the Gulf of Maine, so are subject to all potential effects with respect to offshore wind discussed in section 1.2.\n\n\nH.1.1.3 Shortnose Sturgeon\nShortnose sturgeon are born in freshwater, move between fresh and salt water to feed and migrate, and return to freshwater for breeding (SSSRT, 2010). They spend a majority of their time in estuarine environments and move farther inland to spawn. While it was originally thought that shortnose sturgeon spent little time in the ocean (Kynard, B., 1997), movement between river systems was documented in the Gulf of Maine (Altenritter et al., 2018). The possibility of a similar long range movement was suggested after a shortnose sturgeon from the Chesapeake Bay-Delaware DPS was captured in the James River (Balazik, 2017).\nThe shortnose sturgeon is distributed all along the U.S. Atlantic Coast, and extends up into Canada. It is listed as endangered throughout its range under the ESA. They were subject to high levels of fishing historically, and though they are no longer targeted, bycatch is still a concern. Other anthropogenic activity involving their freshwater habitat such as power plant operation, pollution, and dams also remain as threats (SSSRT, 2010). Critical Habitat has not been designated for shortnose sturgeon because their listing under the ESA pre-dates the amendment that requires critical habitat to be designated for newly listed species. So, it is currently not a requirement for NOAA Fisheries to designate their critical habitat.\nDue to their proximity to shore, overlap with nearshore portions of export cable corridors, landfall sites, and port activities are of particular concern, though they are subject to all potential effects with respect to offshore wind discussed in section 1.2.\n\n\nH.1.1.4 Giant Manta Ray\nThe giant manta ray is a cartilaginous fish, and it is the largest ray in the world. Not much is known about its current population size. Internationally, manta rays are captured for their gill rakers (NOAA Fisheries, 2017). In the U.S., mantas are subject to bycatch in recreational fisheries and can become entangled on mooring wires and drown. Vessel strikes also remain a major issue as mantas spend much of their time at the surface. According to unpublished data from the Marine Megafauna Foundation (MMF), 8% of the south Florida juvenile population have been hit by a boat. This is likely an underestimate, as only individuals that survived can be documented. McGregor et al., (McGregor et al., 2019)found that vessel strike injuries heal quickly in the reef manta ray, which illustrates the likelihood for under detection of vessel collisions in the giant manta ray. Mantas are also attracted to light sources, which can thus attract them to vessels and increase the possibility of collision.\nCritical habitat has not been identified for the giant manta ray, as NOAA Fisheries has determined that no region within the United States fits the description and so it is not prudent to determine critical habitat at this time (NOAA Fisheries, 2019). However, manta rays are widely distributed along the East Coast of the United States (Farmer, N.A. et al., 2022), and potential nursery habitat (Pate, J.H. and Marshall, A.D., 2020) and reproductive/foraging areas have been identified off Florida’s east coast (MMF, unpublished data). In the Gulf of Mexico, manta rays are known to be associated with offshore oil and gas platforms in some areas (Childs, Jeffrey Nathaniel, 2001), so similar associations with OSW structures could be expected. The reason behind the association is unknown, and ultimately could be coincidental. Working theories are that mantas are attracted to the lights of the oil rigs, or to their prey that concentrate around the lights and the mantas are following their prey. They could also just be curious about the various activities occurring near the rigs such as diving. Due to the similarities between oil and gas rigs and structures associated with offshore wind, it is possible that there may be a similar pattern of association.\nResearchers are hoping to learn more about the current population and their distribution in the U.S. Atlantic. Due to their overlap with offshore wind activity, giant manta rays are subject to all potential effects with respect to offshore wind discussed in section 1.2. Impacts of most concern for giant manta rays are vessel strike, noise, EMFs, water quality, changes in marine habitat, offshore lighting, and entanglement from gear utilization or anything that snags on the structures or wires in the water column. In addition, manta rays are planktivorous, so the upwelling and concentration of prey due to changes in hydrography could act as an additional attractant.\n\n\nH.1.1.5 Oceanic Whitetip Shark\nThe oceanic whitetip shark is a pelagic highly migratory species globally distributed in tropical and subtropical waters. Little is known about the current population size, especially in the U.S. Atlantic. Historically, the species was widespread and abundant, but experienced a large population decline. However, a recent analysis of observer data in the U.S. Northwest Atlantic Pelagic Longline Fishery from 1992-2018 showed that the population may have stabilized following the decline, with additional evidence showing potential increases after 2010 (NOAA Fisheries, 2020). They typically occur from the surface to 152m in depth (Bonfil, Ramón et al., 2009), leaving them susceptible to commercial bycatch in multiple types of fishing gear, which remains a primary threat today (Young and Carlson, 2020). Utilization in the international shark fin trade has created additional pressures for the species.\nCritical habitat has not been identified for the oceanic whitetip shark as NOAA Fisheries has determined that no region within the United States fits the description, and so it is not prudent to determine critical habitat at this time (NOAA Fisheries, 2020). However, Howey-Jordan et al., (Howey-Jordan et al., 2013) found that while oceanic whitetip sharks are typically found in waters further offshore, they do migrate to and from shallower reefs and exhibit site fidelity. McCandless et al., (McCandless et al., 2023)reviewed and synthesized the potential effects of offshore wind development on HMS.  According to the report, the oceanic whitetip shark may be subject to all potential effects discussed in section 1.2., but of particular concern is exposure to EMF, exposure to sound pressure and particle motion, and potential hydrodynamic alterations due to presence of structures. Entanglement, both primary and secondary, will remain a threat to this species. On the other hand, turbines will likely create a fish aggregating device affecting aggregating their prey species. Oil rigs and other vertical structures like wrecks and artificial reefs have been shown to attract HMS. If beneficial enough, and some wind energy areas are planned to be quite large, this attraction could alter migration routes or migration timing for the oceanic whitetip shark which could have cascading effects.\n\n\nH.1.1.6 Scalloped Hammerhead Shark\nThe scalloped hammerhead is a highly migratory species found in coastal warm temperate and tropical waters. The Northwest Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico DPS, whose distribution encompasses the majority of the RWSC study area, is not listed under the ESA. The Eastern Atlantic DPS and the Central and Southwest Atlantic DPS, which are both listed as Threatened, may overlap with U.S. Atlantic offshore wind activities, though interactions will be limited to Southern Florida and any vessel transits from Europe and the Gulf of Mexico. Research and genetic evidence also suggest that males are highly dispersive, and may be crossing oceans during migration (Daly-Engel et al., 2012). This research indicates that there may be a need to reevaluate the current management strategy for this species (Daly-Engel et al., 2012). Given the current uncertainties, as well as a changing environment, the scalloped hammerhead shark will be further discussed in this chapter. Any research conducted on the scalloped hammerhead can also be used as a test case for other shark species that overlap with offshore wind development in the region. Results and conclusions drawn will likely be representative of expected impacts and associated effects to other shark species. \nToday, its main threats are interactions with commercial and recreational fisheries (as bycatch, and also as a target in the shark fin trade), habitat degradation, and vessel mortality. Individuals have also been found to accumulate pollutants (Miller, Margaret H. and al., 2014). Critical habitat has not been identified for the scalloped hammerhead shark. NOAA Fisheries has determined that no region within the United States fits the description of critical habitat (NOAA Fisheries, 2015). As noted above, McCandless et al., (McCandless et al., 2023) explored existing scientific literature on the potential effects of offshore wind development on HMS. Given their findings, the scalloped hammerhead shark may be subject to all potential effects discussed in section 1.2., but exposure to EMF, exposure to sound pressure and particle motion, and potential hydrodynamic alterations due to the presence of structures are of greatest concern. Primary and secondary entanglement will remain threats to this species during activities related to offshore wind development. However, the scalloped hammerhead shark will likely benefit from the presence of structures, as other vertical structures such as oil rigs, wrecks and artificial reefs have been shown to attract HMS. It is anticipated that turbines will similarly create a fish aggregating device effect, aggregating prey species. If the large wind energy areas prove significantly beneficial, this could alter the scalloped hammerhead migration routes and/or timing which could have cascading effects.\n\n\nH.1.1.7 Nassau Grouper\nThe Nassau grouper is a reef fish generally found close to shore as larvae, but move into deeper reef areas as they grow. Historical information on its population is limited as fishing records for grouper were not separated by species, though they were known to be very common (NOAA Fisheries, 2013). This species produces sound that is thought to be associated with distress, and this call can be detected on many acoustic monitors.\nCritical habitat has been proposed off the coasts of southeastern Florida, Puerto Rico, Navassa, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. In the RWSC study area, the Nassau grouper is only found in Florida.\nBased on available information and the current BOEM Offshore wind lease planning areas, it is not expected that the Nassau grouper will be greatly impacted by offshore wind development on the U.S. Atlantic coast due to its limited distribution in the range of currently proposed development. However, if development expands, the Nassau grouper would be subject to all effects with respect to offshore wind discussed in section 1.2. Also, as a reef fish that has been documented to utilize natural and artificial reefs, the Nassau grouper may benefit from the alteration of soft bottom habitat associated with offshore wind.\n\n\nH.1.1.8 Smalltooth Sawfish\nThe smalltooth sawfish is a cartilaginous fish that lives in subtropical to tropical climates. They suffered a decline due to fisheries bycatch and habitat loss, and there is not currently a population estimate for the species (Wiley and Brame, 2018).\nThe U.S. population of the smalltooth sawfish is listed as endangered under the ESA. Critical habitat for the smalltooth sawfish is currently proposed and shown below in Figure 3. There is a small section overlapping the RWSC study area in southeast Florida. New research, however, suggests that the smalltooth sawfish may be expanding farther north along the U.S. Atlantic into formerly occupied habitats (Lehman et al., 2022). Lehman et al., (2022) used eDNA to verify anecdotal reports of occupancy in the Indian River Lagoon, Florida and near Deer Island in the Mississippi Sound. The smalltooth sawfish is subject to all to all potential effects with respect to offshore wind discussed in section 1.2.\n\n\n\nFigure H.3: Smalltooth Sawfish Critical Habitat. Source: NOAA Fisheries\n\n\n\n\nH.1.1.9 Whitespotted Eagle Ray\nThe whitespotted eagle ray is found in tropical to warm temperate waters and is mostly found close to shore. It was recently petitioned to be listed as threatened or endangered under the ESA, with fishing pressure as a major concern and added threats from habitat loss and climate change (Defend Them All Foundation, 2023). It is currently in the 90-day evaluation process.\nAn assessment to determine critical habitat has not yet been completed. The whitespotted eagle ray is subject to all to all potential effects with respect to offshore wind discussed in section 1.2."

    "text": "H.2 Potential Effects with Respect to Offshore Wind\nAs a group with varied distributive boundaries, some protected fish are more likely than others to overlap with leased and planned offshore wind areas including cable routes in the Atlantic Ocean. There are multiple potential impacts from offshore wind development on fish species. Impacts can be direct or indirect, as there may also be changes to: protected fish prey species’ distribution/abundance, local and regional hydrodynamics, or other environmental factors that will in turn effect protected fish. The descriptions of potential effects to protected fish such as underwater noise, vessel collision, entanglement, introduction of new structures, and electromagnetic fields are summarized in the Environmental Effects of U.S. Offshore Wind Energy Development: Compilation of Educational Research Briefs (SEER, 2022) and the Synthesis of the Science (Hogan et al., 2023). The gaps and needs are captured in the Atlantic Offshore Wind Environmental Research Recommendations as well as (Hogan et al., 2023). Due to knowledge gaps regarding protected fish and their life stages, the Subcommittee is aware that there might be unanticipated positive or negative effects.\nOffshore wind development will alter benthic habitat as a result of hardening, boulder removal, seabed leveling, dredging, port expansion, and anchoring. Cable placement, scour protection, and the turbines themselves will all create hard structures where there previously was soft benthic habitat or open water. These alterations and associated changes will have varied effects on different species. Loss of large stretches of soft bottom habitat may force species to find new suitable areas to use for habitat, foraging, and other activities. This could result in increased energy expenditures and may decrease individual fitness (Hogan et al., 2023). The additional hard surfaces will also act as artificial reef structures, providing new habitats and shelter, likely attracting structure-oriented fish. The initial increase in fish abundance around structures will likely be from the redistribution of existing individuals rather than an increase in overall abundance. These individuals may then draw in HMS (Degraer et al., 2020). An increase in pelagic predators would increase predation risk for some protected species where previously there had been little or none. The increased concentration around each structure may also expand fishing activity. Higher levels of fishing activity in turn increases the risk of entanglement in fishing gear for protected fish, both primarily by active fishing activity and secondarily through ghost gear that is caught on the hard structures. The structures may also provide the opportunity for non-native species to colonize the area, and potentially facilitate their spread through the stepping stone effect. The expansion of non-native species can have an ecological impact on the area (Adams et al., 2014; De Mesel et al., 2015), and the protected species that use it. The alteration of soft benthic habitat will change the ecosystem, which can have both positive and negative effects on different fish species.\nA seven-year study on demersal fish and invertebrates was conducted to determine if the Block Island Wind Farm (BIWF) had any beneficial or adverse effects on fish presence in the area. This was the first research of its kind in the United States, as the BIWF was the first U.S. wind farm to be established. Results varied by species, with structure-oriented species having higher capture rates inside the wind farm compared to the reference area following turbine construction. Little skate catch per unit effort decreased while spiny dogfish catches were higher during construction (Wilber, 2022). An additional study by Wilber et al., (2022) at the BIWF examined the dietary habits of flounder, gadids, and black seabass before construction, during construction, and during operation. They did not find any substantial changes, but noted that mussels and associated mysids were found in fish diets after construction, indicating their presence on the turbines and foraging by fish. Body condition impacts fluctuated from species to species. For example, silver hake had a slightly higher body condition during operations while multiple species of flounder were found to have decreased body conditions during wind farm operations (Wilber, 2022). While none of the species examined in either Wilber et al. study are protected, the studies give insight as to how different species might react to further wind farm development in the U.S. Atlantic and details the need for further research on this topic as developments expand.\nThere has been more research investigating the effect of offshore wind on fish in Europe. Degraer, S. et al., (Degraer, S. et al., 2018)conducted a study that examined the effects of offshore wind construction and operation on fish communities in the North Sea. Overall, they found an increase in fish abundance during the construction phase compared to the time period before construction. There was also a shift in species, where some became more prevalent and others did not. There was limited data on effects to fish after construction. This study highlights that some fish will be attracted to the newly formed hard structures in the water column and their associated hardening of benthic habitats, known as the reef effect. Others may avoid the area, whether it be due to the presence of noise, predators, electromagnetic fields, alterations to the benthic communities, or other factors.\nFish migration and seasonal habitat selection are intrinsically linked to annual oceanographic patterns that vary latitudinally, and any alterations to these patterns or their resulting ecosystem can have cascading effects on ecosystem function and associated food webs. The presence of structures has the potential to alter oceanographic, hydrodynamic, and atmospheric processes at multiple scales. Wind turbines extract energy from the system, resulting in reduced wind speed downstream and increased turbulence (Christiansen et al., 2022). These are known as atmospheric wakes, which merge together downstream when multiple turbines are clustered together (Christiansen et al., 2022). Increased turbulence can result in changes in circulation and stratification, which has potential implications on primary production and thus may impact fish distribution, including protected fish prey (Berkel et al., 2020; Carpenter et al., 2016; Daewel et al., 2022). The Mid-Atlantic Cold Pool, a mass of cooler bottom waters that forms throughout the Mid-Atlantic Bight in the spring and dissipates as a result of mixing events in the fall, supports marine ecosystems and regulates the migratory behaviors of many fish (Miles et al., 2021). The Cold Pool could be impacted by structure driven changes in stratification. It is therefore extremely important that wind wakes, associated changes to the thermocline and seasonal nutrient mixing are further studied, as changes may have large impacts not only on protected fish species, but also on the entire ecosystem.\nCertain anatomical features of different fish species make them more susceptible to different impacts. For example, sharks, rays, and sturgeon have ampullae of Lorenzini, which are electro-receptive organs, linked to prey detection and navigation. Thus, alterations in ambient electromagnetic fields could affect their ability to feed and migrate normally. The effect of EMF emitted by HVDC subsea cables on little skate was examined in a study by BOEM, and though little skate are not protected, this study can help inform the potential behavioral patterns of electro-sensitive species when exposed to EMF introduced by offshore wind farms. The study found that when exposed to EMF, skates traveled further but slower, spent more time closer to the seabed, and made more large turns compared to behaviors observed in the control enclosure (Hutchison, Z. L. et al., 2018). BOEM noted that there is a need to study behavioral responses to higher levels of EMF. Multiple projects have investigated the effects of EMF on salmon. Scanlan et al., (Scanlan et al., 2018) conducted a study on nonanadromous Atlantic salmon, and found that juveniles oriented differently when exposed to varying levels of magnetic treatment. This study demonstrated that Atlantic salmon are able to detect spatial information from the surrounding geomagnetic field. Minkoff et al. (Minkoff et al., 2020), similarly conducted magnetic displacement experiments on Atlantic salmon, but compared two different populations. They found that while the movement of anadromous juveniles supported native migration patterns, nonanadromous salmon did not respond to the displacement. Klimley et al. (Klimley et al., 2017), conducted a study on the effect of distortions in the earth‘s main magnetic field on Chinook salmon smolts and adult green sturgeon which both migrate through the San Francisco Estuary. Both species successfully migrated past the source of large magnetic anomalies, suggesting that the change in magnetic field would not present a strong barrier to their movement patterns. McIntyre, A et al. (McIntyre, A et al., 2016), found that submarine HV cables did not cause any significant behavioral changes in sub-adult Atlantic sturgeon. It is clear through the results of these studies that more research is needed on additional life stages of protected fish species to gain a more thorough understanding of the impact that EMF will have on protected fish.\nAll stages of offshore wind development create underwater noise, which can result in effects to fish. These activities include, but are not limited to, pile driving, vessel traffic, aircraft, drilling, G&G surveys, jet-plowing, seabed preparation, UXO detonations, and turbine operation. Effects from sound range include non-auditory injury, auditory injury, physiological changes, behavioral disruption, and masking of communication. Impacts will vary depending on intensity of the noise source and detection abilities of the fish. Most teleosts have a swim bladder, which plays an important role in buoyancy maintenance of individual fish. These organs are susceptible to rapid changes in pressure and physical trauma (Gedamke, J. et al., 2016), which can occur through impulsive noise sources which are created during impact pile driving and pre-construction activities such as UXO detonations, HRG surveys, and geotechnical drilling surveys. Popper et al. (Popper AN et al., 2016), studied the effect of seismic air guns on Pallid sturgeon, and found that single pulses were not lethal, though the effects of multiple exposures remains to be studied. As there will be multiple exposures in each wind energy area, and many on a regional scale, this is an important area of continued research. While little research has been done on Atlantic sturgeon specifically, studies have been conducted on Lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens), a similar species. Lovell et al. (Lovell et al., 2005), investigated lake sturgeon hearing and found them to be responsive to particle motion rather than sound pressure. In a study that observed pile driving effects on lake sturgeon, a variety of injuries were reported including a partially deflated swim bladder, renal hematoma, and bruised kidneys (Halvorsen MB et al., 2012). Fleeing and avoidance of areas with active pile driving is likely to occur.\nIn addition to impulsive noise, offshore wind development will add continuous noise to the environment, mainly through wind turbine operation and increased vessel traffic. While continuous noise has lower pressure levels, so is less likely to cause an auditory injury, it can result in other impacts such as behavioral changes and masking of communication. Fish use sound for a variety of activities, including but not limited to, reproduction, feeding, when under threat, and even swimming (Kasumyan, A., 2009). Noise sources that overlap with the hearing frequency of fish can affect their ability to communicate via sound, and in some cases have direct impacts on their survival. In a study conducted on Ambon damselfish (Pomacentrus amboinensis) by Simpson, S. et al., (Simpson, S. et al., 2016), it was determined that exposure to motorboat sound increased their metabolic rate. This stress response slowed their active response to simulated strikes, and allowed them to be captured by predators at more than twice the rate compared to periods of ambient noise. Size of the turbine and speed of rotation can shift the frequency of created sound. Tougaard, Jakob et al., (Tougaard, Jakob et al., 2020) found that turbine operation source levels have lower frequency than ship noise in the same range, though ships move away from the area and turbines remain stationary for the life of the project. Through modeling, they determined that cumulative levels of turbine noise can be detected up to a few kilometers from the wind farm, with levels shifting in the presence of other loud noise sources (Tougaard, Jakob et al., 2020). Multiple types of turbine foundations are proposed for development in the region, each with different construction requirements and thus different noise related impacts. Marmo et al. (Marmo et al., 2013) investigated the use of jacket, monopile, and gravity foundations in Scotland on multiple species including Atlantic salmon. They concluded that Atlantic salmon are able to detect monopiles at larger ranges than gravity bases, but whether this affects their behavior is yet to be determined. The farther away a fish is from the turbine or wind energy area, the smaller the projected impact from underwater noise. Due to the regional scale development of offshore wind farms in the study area, operational noise impacts should be studied further, with specific regard to any changes that may result in movement and behavior. The accepted acoustic thresholds for protected fish were developed by the Fisheries Hydroacoustic Working Group (FHWG) (fisherieshydroacousticworkinggroup?)and (Popper et al., 2014), and are presented in the National Marine Fisheries Service: Summary of Endangered Species Act Acoustic Thresholds (Marine Mammals, Fishes, and Sea Turtles).\nPlumes of turbid water can be observed as a result of offshore wind development activities such as pile driving, dredging, and port expansion. High levels of suspended sediment in the water column can result in a reduction of dissolved oxygen and altered visibility (Berry et al., 2003). Both decreased oxygen and increased sedimentation in the water can cause physiological stress in marine fish. Berg & Northcote, (Berg and Northcote, 1985) documented behavioral changes in juvenile coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) such as decreased capture success, lower percentage of ingested prey, and increased gill flaring when exposed to short-term pulses of suspended sediment. If the period of exposure increases, the effects of increased turbidity can be lethal (Johnson, A., 2018). While mobile fish are able to avoid areas of increased sedimentation, eggs and larvae may be buried when sediment is redeposited on the seafloor. This resettlement can result in a decreased rate of survival (Wilber and Clarke, 2001). Sediment Dispersion Modeling is being conducted and made public to show impacts from sediment resuspension during Project construction activities, such as for Vineyard Wind 1 (Crowley and Swanson, 2018). Dredging may also directly affect sturgeon or benthic prey species through impingement, entrainment or capture.\nAny addition of vessels, both in number and in time spent in the area, increases the possibility of vessel strike. Vessel strike of the Atlantic sturgeon and giant manta ray have been extensively documented (Balazik, Matthew et al., 2012; Pate, J.H. and Marshall, A.D., 2020),and is listed as a threat to recovery for shortnose sturgeon. Offshore wind development utilizes various types of vessels that range in size and purpose. Current EISs evaluate vessel strike risk based on the estimated increase in vessel number in the project area. The Subcommittee would like to stress the importance of expanding this to include the increased amount of time vessels will remain in the project area, especially if the propeller is constantly running. Size of wheel, depth, location of vessels, vessel speed and draft should also be assessed with regards to vessel strike in each region over different seasons. An increased number of vessels in the area additionally results in an increased risk of accidental release. This can come in the form of chemical spills, such as fuel and oil, as well as release of other trash and debris. Fluids may also leak from turbines and offshore substations. Exposure and/or ingestion of chemicals and debris can negatively impact protected fish themselves, as well as the water quality surrounding the release.\nListed below based on existing research and Subcommittee expertise are the potential short-term and long-term effects of offshore wind development on protected fish species.\n\nH.2.1 Potential short-term impacts of offshore wind pre-construction activities\n\nNoise from seismic surveys\nIncreased vessel traffic\n\n\n\nH.2.2 Potential short-term impacts of offshore wind construction activities\n\nSedimentation/plumes in water column at the turbines and along the cable route\nImpulsive noise from pile driving and HRG surveys\nNon-impulsive noise from construction vessels\nExposure to accidental release\nExposure to lighting\nVessel strike\nDisturbance of benthic habitat from possible leveling, anchoring, boulder removal, dredging and port expansion\nDischarges/intakes/entrainment\n\n\n\nH.2.3 Potential long-term impacts of offshore wind operation and maintenance\n\nPresence of structures in the water column.

These changes will have impacts on species that use created habitat and expose species to new conditions. It is thought that the impacts of conceptual decommissioning on protected fish may be major. As the life span of each project is expected to be 30 years, the Subcommittee will further investigate potential impacts and research needs for the decommissioning stage at a later date. This includes the review of decommissioned oil and gas platforms in the Gulf of Mexico, the comparison of different methods utilized, and the varying impacts to protected fish populations and their behavior.\nThe Subcommittee would also like to note that each of these impact producing factors may individually affect protected fish species, but they also have the potential for cumulative and synergistic effects. Impacts need to be assessed at the project level as well as at the cumulative level throughout the region."

    "section": "H.3 Sources of Regional-Scale Protected Fish Distribution Information",
    "text": "H.3 Sources of Regional-Scale Protected Fish Distribution Information\nScientific surveys have taken place region wide for decades. They employ multiple methods, target multiple species, and provide spatial and temporal data for a wide variety of species. These surveys may encounter various protected fish species, where data are collected, samples are taken, and resuscitation is provided if needed. The federal government, state governments, universities, citizen science programs, and other research organizations have supported this long standing and essential data collection. Conventional tag, sighting, and bycatch data are also collected for some protected fish species, and contribute to what is known about each species. These are all crucial to the monitoring of protected fish, especially given their migration patterns throughout the region.\nDespite the long-standing effort, much is still unknown about each protected fish species and their life stages. Telemetry, both acoustic and satellite, is a data collection method that is regularly deployed for many species of protected fish as well as other taxa in the region. Fish are acoustically tagged in one location and can be detected for the life of the applied tag on existing arrays. Researchers communicate to discover the source of outside tags detected on their arrays, and to find out where their tagged fish have been detected. This collaboration allows for an increased knowledge on regional fish distribution, migration patterns, and seasonality. Many researchers studying protected species utilize data sharing networks and systems, which are described below, amongst other sources or regional-scale distribution information.\n\nH.3.1 The Atlantic Cooperative Telemetry Network (ACT)\n“A grassroots effort to facilitate data sharing between researchers utilizing acoustic telemetry to gain a greater understanding of a wide variety of aquatic species. What started with 15 researchers working on Atlantic and shortnose sturgeon that year has expanded to over 138 from Maine to Florida working with over 95 different species. Researchers maintain their own arrays, so transmitters deployed and array sizes are dependent on seasonal conditions, research needs, and available funding (“The atlantic cooperative telemetry network,” n.d.).” In 2020, the ACT Network merged with the Mid-Atlantic Acoustic Telemetry Observation System (MATOS). Since then, ACT data are housed in the ACT-MATOS database, which is a web-based tool and database for researchers and natural resource professionals to manage acoustic telemetry data in a searchable, secure database. ACT uses OTN data formats and data sharing occurs in collaboration with OTN, FACT and some other regional networks (MATOS, n.d.).”\n\n\nH.3.2 The FACT Network\n“The FACT Network is a grassroots collaboration of marine scientists using acoustic telemetry and other technologies to better understand and conserve our region’s important fish and sea turtle species. The FACT Network originated as the Florida Atlantic Coast Telemetry Network but has since grown to include partners from the Bahamas to the Carolinas and is now known simply as the FACT Network. –It’s purpose is to expand the scale and cost effectiveness of behavioral studies through partnerships and data sharing, encourage new projects and student involvement with an inclusive research atmosphere, and communicate findings to policy makers and the public to guide coastal management decisions (SECOORA, 2023).” FACT uses OTN data formats and data sharing occurs in collaboration with OTN, ACT and some other regional networks.\n\n\nH.3.3 Ocean Tracking Network (OTN)\n“The Ocean Tracking Network (OTN) is a global aquatic research, data management and partnership platform headquartered at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. OTN’s mission is to inform the stewardship and sustainable management of aquatic animals by providing knowledge on their movements, habitats and survival in the face of changing global environments. Since 2008, OTN has been deploying state-of-the-art ocean monitoring equipment and marine autonomous vehicles (gliders) in key ocean locations and inland waters around the world. OTN’s technical capabilities expanded in 2020 with the addition of remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) and side scan sonar systems. Researchers around the world are using OTN’s global infrastructure and analytical tools to document the movements and survival of aquatic animals in the context of changing ocean and freshwater environments (Ocean Tracking Network, 2023).” OTN also supports regional, national, and international data sharing efforts.\n\n\nH.3.4 NMFS Long-Term Scientific Surveys\nNMFS Long-term protected species, fisheries, and ecosystem surveys form the backbone of the scientific monitoring system needed for the management of wildlife, fisheries, habitats, and ecosystems. In order understand potential changes in wildlife and habitats from offshore wind energy development, it is critical that long-term standardized surveys continue to provide timely, accurate, and precise data on wildlife, habitats, and ecosystems. The need to fully implement the NMFS and BOEM Survey Mitigation Strategy (Hare et al., 2022) is critical to putting site and regional level studies in the context of population trends and ecosystem conditions. The Strategy calls for the development of a Northeast Survey Mitigation Program. This is largely unfunded, but it is highlighted as a significant priority for the region and protected species science. Similar mitigation strategies will need to be applied in the southeastern U.S. as offshore wind development advances.\n\n\nH.3.5 Regional Passive Acoustic Monitoring Network\nThe RWSC Marine Mammal Subcommittee has been coordinating around the planning and implementation of a regional passive acoustic monitoring network for understanding effects of offshore wind on large whales (e.g., displacement or attraction, changes in behavior). Not all fish make noise, but those that do would be detected on some acoustic systems deployed to detect large whales. Of the ESA listed fish in the RWSC study area, the Nassau grouper produces sounds that are thought to be made in a period of alarm. Though it is not well understood, Atlantic sturgeon also make noise. More research should be dedicated to sturgeon sound production so that PAM can be better utilized to study them. In addition, many small fish that serve as prey species make sounds that are detected on passive acoustic monitors, and can give a better understanding of the whole ecosystem. Many of the deployed PAM instruments have also been outfitted with acoustic receivers, including all deployed by the NEFSC. The Protected Fish Species Subcommittee should coordinate with the Marine Mammal Subcommittee to make this information more readily available to both groups.\n\n\nH.3.6 Observer Data and Reports\nIn the RWSC study area, there are multiple observer programs that collect data from commercial fishing vessels and fish processing plants. The Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) and Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC) trains and supports federal observers for their respective regions. Some states also support their own observer programs and data collection. Observer data are essential for the monitoring and conservation of NOAA trust resources, and are used to support stock assessments and fishery management, reduce bycatch, document species, and support the research community. Observers do come into contact with some protected fish species, and record biological information, locational data, and may collect samples depending on the species.\n\n\nH.3.7 ESA 5-Year Reviews\nEvery five years, the status (i.e., threatened or endangered) of ESA-listed fish is reviewed to ensure they maintain the appropriate level of protection under the ESA. The reviews assess whether a species’ status has changed since the time of its listing or its last status review, and whether it should be classified differently or delisted. Information gathered during those reviews can help inform management activities intended to support species recovery."

    "section": "H.4 RWSC Study Area",
    "text": "H.4 RWSC Study Area\nThe RWSC study area is organized by subregion along the U.S. Atlantic coast, roughly aligned with current offshore wind development planning areas. RWSC subregions and map are described on page 2 of Chapter 2: Science Plan Organization. Many protected fish are distributed across multiple subregions, and it is important to gain a regional perspective on the changing environments. The Subcommittee would like to stress that in all subregions, fine-scale baseline data on protected fish and their life stages are still needed. Without established baselines, assessing and mitigating effects of offshore wind will be challenging.\nThe Gulf of Maine, where offshore wind projects are still in the planning phases, has a range of marine habitats from deep sea canyons to rocky intertidal zones. These habitats support a wide variety of marine organisms including multiple species of protected fish. The Gulf of Maine also connects rivers that are the only remaining wild habitat for Atlantic salmon. More robust baseline data about the occurrence, distribution, and movement of protected fish species and their life stages in this region are needed. These data should be collected via telemetry and eDNA and paired with classic methods such as trawl surveys. All efforts, regardless of tool/method should use consistent data collection protocols in consultation with the Protected Fish Species Subcommittee. Oceanographic variables such as temperature, currents, tides, salinity, and other contextual information (e.g., quantifications of vessel traffic, EMF) should be co-collected or obtained from collaborators (e.g., NERACOOS, Rutgers, MARACOOS) to provide context and help identify drivers of species’ distribution and movement. Wind projects in this region will utilize floating structures. Many of the same impacts from traditionally anchored piles will apply to floating offshore wind, though floating offshore structures incorporate new technologies such as mooring lines that span the entire water column. The subcommittee would like to test how these lines will impact protected fish species, such as their potential to cause secondary entanglement. The University of Maine’s VulturnUS 1:8 floating turbine was energized and monitored, and no change to detection frequency was seen for tagged Atlantic salmon, Atlantic Sturgeon, or shortnose sturgeon on receivers near the turbine (Brady, 2015). Focal species in these regions include Atlantic salmon, Atlantic sturgeon and shortnose sturgeon. The oceanic whitetip shark and giant manta ray may also be found in this region.\nSouthern New England and NY/NJ Bight has a variety of habitats that are used as spawning, feeding, and migration corridors for many species. The Cold Pool is a key oceanographic feature of the MAB that supports many fish species. In southern New England, offshore wind development has already begun. While small in scale, the Block Island Wind Farm (BIWF) became the first in the U.S., and construction has begun for additional projects. Existing baseline data collected using multiple tools such as acoustic telemetry, satellite telemetry, eDNA, and trawl surveys need to be integrated to characterize protected fish species’ distribution and movement pre-offshore wind construction. It is also essential to emphasize the continuation of data collection and monitoring throughout all phases of development. Additional data collection activities should also explore the potential impacts from floating wind in the deeper waters along/off the shelf break. These analyses should leverage characterizations of the potential stressors of interest, including quantifications of vessel traffic changes, EMF, sediment resuspension, and entrainment. Close collaboration between researchers and developers is needed to avoid duplication of efforts. Focal species in these regions include Atlantic sturgeon and shortnose sturgeon. The oceanic whitetip shark and giant manta ray are also found in this region.\nIn Central Atlantic and Southeastern U.S. Atlantic, baseline data collection on the occurrence, distribution, and movement of protected fish is still needed. There is an emphasis to begin monitoring activities in the Central Atlantic, as projects in this subregion are farther along in the development process. The Central Atlantic is home to the Atlantic sturgeon, shortnose sturgeon, and giant manta ray. The whitespotted eagle ray is also found in this region. These species are also distributed in the southeastern U.S. Atlantic, as well as the listed Central & Southwest Atlantic distinct population segment of scalloped hammerhead shark, Nassau grouper, and smalltooth sawfish, though offshore wind development in the Southeastern U.S. Atlantic is still in the planning process."

    "text": "H.5 Research Recommendations: Protected fish and Offshore Wind in the U.S. Atlantic Ocean\nEfforts to address fish and offshore wind have already begun. The following research recommendations aim to build on existing research to fill data gaps and advance the understanding of protected fish species. The Subcommittee curated research recommendations around four major research themes that were decided upon by the RWSC Steering committee: understanding the environmental context around changes to wildlife and habitats, detecting and quantifying changes to wildlife and habitats; mitigating negative impacts that are likely to occur and/or are severe in magnitude; and enhancing data sharing and access. These recommendations fall into three categories: data collection, data analysis, and data management. The Subcommittee would like to note that assigning causality to observed changes may not be possible, especially with the lack of baseline data on many protected fish species in a rapidly changing environment. Collecting long-term data series before, during, and after construction will aid in the ability to distinguish shifts caused by different factors such as natural variation and climate change, though this task remains challenging.\n\nH.5.1 Data Collection\nSeveral entities are requiring, funding, and/or advocating for protected fish species research and data collection activities with respect to offshore wind. All ongoing and pending activities, including protected fish species monitoring that is being required by agencies, are captured in the RWSC Offshore Wind & Wildlife Research Database. Individuals and entities should consult with the Protected Fish Species Subcommittee prior to collecting protected fish species data with respect to offshore wind to ensure that any new data collection does not duplicate existing efforts and is consistent with the tools and approaches already in use. Any individual or entity may join public Protected Fish Species Subcommittee meetings by obtaining meeting links on the RWSC website, where past meeting materials are also available\nTo address the potential effects of offshore wind development on protected fish, a variety of methods are currently being employed. A combination of methods is recommended to provide the most complete information and context. The table below describes data collection methods utilized to study protected fish.\nTable 3. Data Collection Methods and Descriptions. This table summarizes data collection methods that are currently being used to study protected fish species.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Collection Method\nDescription\n\n\nAcoustic telemetry\nIncludes deploying acoustic transmitters on animals and deploying receivers to detect tagged animals.\n\n\nSatellite telemetry\nSatellite tags are attached to animals, GPS and various environmental data are collected.\n\n\nConventional tagging\nVarious types of non-electronic tags can be attached to protected fish both internally and externally.\n\n\neDNA\nEnvironmental DNA (eDNA) is shed by an organism and can be picked up in the environment via water sample collection.

Hydrophones can be stationary or mobile. Reporting can be done in real time or stored and archived.\n\n\nSalvage operations\nRespond to reports of stranded animals (dead or alive/in distress) and take the appropriate steps given the condition of the animal.\n\n\nBiological sampling and measurements\nFrom captured individuals, collect body measurements and/or samples of biological material such as fin clips. Physiological measurements including stress hormones from blood, blow, mucus, tissue, fecal samples, etc. Proper animal handling protocols should always be used when collecting samples and taking measurements. NOAA Fisheries and the AZA are two entities that provide safe handling guidelines.\n\n\nWater quality and oceanography\nIn-situ measurements of abiotic properties including salinity, dissolved oxygen, temperature, etc.\n\n\n\nMost offshore-wind-specific monitoring to-date of protected fish species in the U.S. Atlantic is occurring in Southern New England and the NY/NJ Bight on Atlantic sturgeon, with the goal of characterizing baseline distribution and movement. There are also significant and ongoing data collection efforts in estuaries and coastal areas throughout the United States. While most of these efforts are not explicitly related to offshore wind, their findings can be used to augment the baseline understanding of protected fish species in the region. Via cooperative and collaborative networks, these independent efforts will help build a larger understanding of fish movement, abundance, and use of the region over space and time. This, in turn, will help to detect changes resulting from the development of offshore wind.\nAs previously noted, NMFS long-term scientific surveys are a critical monitoring system for the management of wildlife, fisheries, habitats, and ecosystems. In order to understand potential changes in protected fish species and their habitats from offshore wind energy development, it is essential that these long-term standardized surveys continue to provide timely, accurate, and precise data. The need to fully implement the NMFS and BOEM Survey Mitigation Strategy and apply a similar strategy to the southeast region is highlighted as a significant priority for regional protected fish research and monitoring.\nThe Subcommittee lists the following priorities and recommends associated data collection activities, noting that these recommendations are to be reviewed and updated on a regular basis:\nCollect information on distribution, abundance, behavior, health, reproduction, and other vital population rates of protected fish at all life stages. This includes estuarine and freshwater habitat if distribution expands into those environments. It is imperative to gain a better spatiotemporal understanding of protected species and their migration patterns to assert when and how they are most likely to use WEAs. Due to the differing ecosystems across the region, and migration patterns of multiple species of protected fish, it is important that data is collected on a region-wide scale. All life stages should be examined. To study early life stages, dispersal models and plankton cameras should be utilized. This includes attraction/avoidance, residency, feeding, use of area. Data collected will be used to understand changes to the environment resulting from offshore wind development.\n\nDeploy fine-scale acoustic receiver arrays in and around leased and proposed Wind Energy Areas and associated cable routes. Pair deployments with acoustic and satellite tagging of protected fish. Note that tags have limited operating time, so tagging operations will need to continue over the life of the project.\n\nPlan and implement telemetry data collection activities in a consistent way, such that data and metadata from individual projects is standardized and interoperable.\nUtilize additional data collection methods such as conventional tagging (i.e. non-electronic), eDNA, and others in collaboration with telemetry to aid the identification of changes in residency or usage of the area.\nExpand projects like Buoys of Opportunity across the region to co-locate acoustic receivers to structures already in/going in the water.\n\nFacilitate coordination with other entities such as federal agencies, states, researchers, fishermen, industry, eNGOs, etc. to know when and where receivers can be installed.\n\nEvaluate the presence and stability of current acoustic receiver arrays and design new infrastructure to ensure spatial and temporal coverage of wind energy areas and other important habitat areas for protected species.\n\nEncourage industry to make participation in regional networks a condition of funding.\n\nCouple on-bottom deployment of acoustic receivers with bottom temperature measurements to the extent possible.\nRequire that all new tags/groups submit their data to the Animal Telemetry Network and/or appropriate regional nodes in an agreed upon time frame to allow for archiving, securing, and publishing.\nEnsure that monitoring begins prior to pre-construction activities and continues throughout all phases of development, including after decommissioning.\n\nDesign a distributed region wide system of receiver arrays that serve as the backbone for projects throughout the region. This includes receivers offshore/along the shelf which are limited in the current project landscape.\n\nEnsure that this system has sustained investment for operation and maintenance.\nRequire that all new tags/groups submit their data to the Animal Telemetry Network and/or appropriate regional nodes in an agreed upon time frame to allow for archiving, securing, and publishing.\n\nImplement and fund survey mitigation recommendations articulated in the NOAA Fisheries & BOEM Federal Survey Mitigation Strategy (Hare et al., 2022).\n\nSupport the successful completion of objective 1.2.3 of the Strategy to develop an inter-agency resource plan to support a survey mitigation program.\n\nFunding and resources will need to be given to address project level and cumulative effects of offshore wind farms to scientific surveys.\n\nAs offshore wind development expands into different regions, a strategy for the southeast will be developed. We will also support its implementation.\n\nCollect biological samples, body measurements and additional metrics on captured protected fish.\n\nCollect as part of directed studies or opportunistically when a protected fish species is captured on a survey.\n\nProvide a more thorough understanding of each species and life stage.\n\n\nConduct field studies to fully document giant manta ray migration\n\nUtilize multiple methods such as aerial surveys, boat-based surveys, and external tagging to fully understand the difference in habitat use, and resulting threats to, the two species of manta ray to aid in their conservation.\n\nCollect and analyze data to support development of an adult distribution model for smalltooth sawfish.\nCollect and analyze data to support development of larval and adult connectivity/distribution models for Nassau grouper.\n\nEvaluate the risks of known impact producing factors to protected fish from offshore wind development.\n\nDevelop tools and monitoring mechanisms to better understand coastal transfer of protected fish species, if/when vessel strikes occur, and what vessels are typically involved. It is important to understand the change in vessel traffic in offshore wind farm project areas with emphasis on shallower waters close to ports and estuaries, in known migration corridors, and other areas of spatiotemporal overlap. The scope of current studies on risk of vessel strike needs to be expanded. Instead of focusing only on the number of additional vessels, studies should target the amount of time propellers are spinning in place, different wheel sizes, and different depths where vessels are present for each OSW project.\n\nCoordinate with state agencies for recorded information on protected fish sightings, incidental catches, and beach strandings, particularly for Atlantic and shortnose sturgeon and giant manta ray.\n\nEnsure sufficient human and financial resources to support local salvage operations. Stranding hotlines and programs already exist for some protected fish species. However, these programs are largely underfunded, and lack the personnel and resources to attend to all reports. Fully studying strandings, both dead and alive, will give researchers a better understanding as to what is affecting the populations in each region and insight as to how to best mitigate these effects.\n\nCoordinate with the RWSC Marine Mammal and Sea Turtle Subcommittees to develop a reporting system for protected fish strandings similar to what is being done for marine mammals and sea turtles.\nEncourage voluntary reporting and data collection for known vessel interactions with protected fish, particularly sturgeon.\nCreate and test mitigation measures to prevent vessel strikes.\nMeasure the amount and type of noise and produced by each vessel and how these change over time.\n\nConduct further laboratory and field studies of EMF effects on protected fish species, especially Chondrichthyes and sturgeons to assess potential impacts, such as any change in migration patterns, feeding, or behavior.\n\nDirected studies in situ of effects of EMF from transmission cables on protected fish species occurrence, movement, behavior, and feeding patterns.\n\nThe Subcommittee would like to build upon existing research and use their recommendations such as exposing animals to higher levels of EMF.\n\nPrioritize conditions similar to where full cable burial is unable to be achieved.\nPrioritize Atlantic and shortnose sturgeon, giant manta ray, and Atlantic salmon, particularly in the adult and smolt life stages.\n\nConduct similar directed studies on protected fish prey species.\n\n\nConduct in situ examinations of noise impacts to protected fish species.\n\nConduct studies on all impulsive and continuous noise sources such as impact pile driving, vibratory pile driving, boat noise, turbine operational noise, aircraft noise, HRG surveys, cable laying activity, etc.\n\nAssess both primary and secondary entanglement risk to all protected fish species associated with offshore wind. There is the potential for increased recreational fishing near wind turbines which would lead to primary entanglement, as well as an increased possibility of secondary entanglement due to ghost gear and debris attaching to structures in the water. Risk should be assessed for structures associated with both standard and floating offshore wind technologies.\n\nIn the southeast region, giant manta ray should be prioritized.\n\n\nCollaborate with other subcommittees to maximize data collection efforts and gain a more thorough understanding of whether or not/to what degree turbines and other structures alter the hydrodynamics, benthic habitat distribution, food resources, stratification and mixing both at the local level directly behind the wind farm and at the cumulative regional level.\n\nMarine Mammal: Maintain a shareable database and/or map of the acoustic telemetry receivers that may be co-located with bottom-mounted PAM hydrophones.\nSea Turtle: Ensure that sea turtle researchers are able to utilize telemetry to arrays if desired.\nTechnology: Test and implement any technological advancements that may be required to continue long-standing data scientific surveys and data collection in areas that are no longer accessible or are accessible in a limited extent that will influence continuity of surveys.\nHabitat and Ecosystem: Work with the Habitat & Ecosystem Subcommittee to ensure that key oceanographic and habitat data are collected and available to use in coordination with studies on protected fish.\n\nIdentify oceanographic and habitat variables of interest with respect to mapping and modeling of protected fish distribution and movement.\n\n\nTechnology advancements to improve protected fish research and monitoring:\n\nDevelop and test telemetry tags with further miniaturization for use with smaller individuals.\n\nEvaluate the use of open protocol telemetry equipment for new studies at offshore wind energy areas.\n\nImprove data resolution and positional accuracy of telemetry tags and test adding sensors (magnetometers, sound, DO, chlorophyll, etc.) to existing tags.\nInvestigate the use of eDNA to accurately measure fish species abundance in addition to occurrence.\nTest methods to make lines in the water more visible to megafauna and more rigid to mitigate entanglements.\n\nMantas do not see well, so anything that would make the cables easier to see will be beneficial.\nContinue to support and fund research and testing of ropeless gear to limit the vertical lines in the water column.\n\nImprove or develop machine learning or AI detection for soniferous protected fish (Nassau grouper, potentially Atlantic and shortnose sturgeon) in Passive Acoustic Data sources. PAM is being utilized by NOAA and wind developers in the region, so ongoing passive acoustic monitoring will maximize this available dataset to both capture changes in the soundscape and detect selected protected fish species.\n\n\n\nH.5.2 Data Analysis\nData analyses should characterize oceanographic and habitat drivers of protected fish species distribution, abundance, and behavior, seek to assess whether offshore wind is causing any observed changes, and inform where new data collection is needed. Individuals and entities should consult with the Protected Fish Species Subcommittee prior to conducting analyses of protected fish species data with respect to offshore wind to ensure that the study leverages all available data and contributes to addressing the key issues described below. The following data analysis activities are needed:\n\nIdentify and use historical data collections from multiple sources to generate a baseline of distribution and abundance of protected fish species.\n\nDetermine/describe useful baseline parameters to be used where thorough abundance and density data are not available.\n\nDevelop best practices for integrating data from multiple methods (telemetry, eDNA, trawl surveys, aerial surveys) across scales to model baseline species’ distribution and movement using oceanographic variables and other contextual information (e.g., quantifications of vessel traffic). The modeling framework should be applicable to individual projects and at regional scales such that consistent approaches are used across projects, and eventually in other subregions of the RWSC study area. This is a primary analytical goal, as it is overall unclear how data from multiple efforts will be analyzed, interpreted, and/or synthesized to develop spatial representations of species occurrence, occupancy, and other potential metrics. It is similarly unclear how species data will be analyzed with environmental data to identify drivers of presence, movement, and/or behavior.\n\nAssess what technology best suits studies for each protected species and life stage.\n\nDevelop standardized data products for protected fish movement data that can be replicated throughout the region.\nAnalyze existing plankton camera data for presence of early life stages of protected fish and protected fish prey. Use this data to develop dispersal models.\nLeverage currently deployed instrumentation and design new studies to examine the effects of impact producing factors derived from construction and operation activities such as pile driving and G&G surveys.\nAttempt to determine the causality of any changes in protected fish abundance, distribution, or behavior. This includes disentangling effects related to offshore wind development from those due to climate change, natural variability, or other causes.\nEnsure that protected fish species are included in risk modeling that is similarly being applied to other species, e.g., Project WOW.\n\nPopulation Viability Analyses\nPopulation Consequences of Disturbance (PCOD)\nPopulation Consequences of Multiple Stressors (PCOMS)\n\nModel potential impacts of intake and entrainment from HVDC cooling systems to protected fish species.\nEvaluate mitigation techniques to limit exposure of sedimentation.\n\nModel predicted patterns of sedimentation/resuspension to estimate potential impacts to protected species. These can be used to advanced current mitigation measures and investigate the development of new measures.\n\nContinually evaluate the performance of existing models and statistical frameworks. Models should be updated as new information becomes available.\n\nUse validation and evaluation results to continually inform and advance the model/framework development and application. Models should be updated as new information becomes available.\n\nDevelop analyses of vessel and protected fish species co-occurrence that model nearshore vessel traffic as well as other areas of spatiotemporal overlap with protected fish such as known migration corridors.\n\n\n\nH.5.3 Data Management\nThe Protected Fish Species Subcommittee will work with individuals and entities who collect data relevant to protected fish studies to ensure that data are collected and stored in consistent formats. This will enhance comparisons and pooling across individual projects in the RWSC study area to conduct regional-scale assessments and to develop and maintain regional-scale data products. The following table lists the existing centralized or accepted repositories and standards that should be used and identifies data types for which no or limited data management capacity (i.e., repositories and standards) currently exists.\nThe Subcommittee will develop guidance specific to protected fish species telemetry data to reconcile (or appropriately leverage) any redundancy among the various existing telemetry data repositories (Movebank, ATN, and the regional telemetry data nodes).\nTable 4: Data Methods, Repositories, and Existing Standards. This table summarizes data collection methods, the existing repository for each method, and describes whether standards exist for that method or need to be developed.\n\n\n\nMethod(s) and data type(s)\nRepository\nExisting Standards\n\n\nObservational surveys; telemetry data; acoustic monitoring; photo identification; oceanographic data products; model outputs\nOBIS-SEAMAP(Ocean Biogeographic Information System – Spatial Ecological Analysis of Megavertebrate Populations\n\nOBIS-SEAMAP minimum data fields and acceptable formats, Duke Marine Geospatial Ecology Lab\n\n\n\nSatellite tagging data; acoustic tagging data through the regional nodes Atlantic Cooperative Telemetry (ACT) and FACT networks\nAnimal Telemetry Network (ATN)\n\nAnimal Telemetry Network DAC Data Management Policy Guidance: includes data submission requirements and instructions for submitting project-level metadata and deployment records via an app and by using Research Workspace.\nNeed to develop guidance specific to protected fish species and to projects lacking federal funding\n\n\n\nAcoustic tagging data\nFACT Network\n\nFACT Network Metadata Template, SECOORA\nNeed to develop guidance specific to protected fish species\n\n\n\nAcoustic tagging data\nAtlantic Cooperative Telemetry Network(ACT Network Data are managed in the ACT-MATOS database following the merger of ACT and MATOS in 2020).\n\nACT Network Metadata Template (available for members to download when logged into website)\nNeed to develop guidance specific to protected fish species\n\n\n\nSatellite tagging, Acoustic tagging, VHF tagging, other tagging\nMovebank\n\nArchiving in the Movebank Data Repository: archiving, DOI assignment, licensing, submission guidelines\nNeed to develop guidance specific to protected fish species\n\n\n\nHigh-definition aerial imagery\nNone; records of observations from photos go to OBIS-SEAMAP\n\nNone – needs development\n\n\n\neDNA\nNone – needs development\n\nNone – needs development\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, the Subcommittee recommends the following:\n\nLeverage ROSA’s work to standardize offshore wind fisheries monitoring plans and trawl surveys so that protected fish species data are accessible for use in RWSC’s and partners’ analyses and research.\nCross taxa: Convene an Offshore Wind & Acoustic Telemetry Data Collaborative with goals to coordinate on the deployment of acoustic telemetry receivers and acoustic and satellite tags on protected fish, and other species of focus within RWSC (e.g., sea turtles), and ROSA (e.g., highly migratory species, Atlantic cod) and in the context of offshore wind development. Include and build on existing work by partners including ATN, FACT, ACT-MATOS Network, OTN, and the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center. The Data Collaborative would ensure that data are collected and stored consistently such that data can be pooled to develop a set of standardized data products that represent metrics such as distribution, abundance, occupancy, movement, etc.\n\nEnsure that data are collected and stored in consistent formats that allow comparisons and pooling across individual projects in the RWSC study area to conduct regional-scale assessments and the development of regional-scale data products.\nDevelop or adopt existing best practices for acoustic telemetry data collection, QA/QC, management, storage, and sharing/accessibility and require their consistent use across taxa/projects.\nEnsure sufficient human resources to support project planning, manage acoustic telemetry databases, collaborate with ATN and OTN on data sharing, and facilitate data compilation and synthesis.\n\nMake recommendations available to funders to communicate the need for sufficient resources\nSupport regular evaluation of infrastructure as more and more data are collected.\n\n\nCharacterize the acoustic telemetry receiver network with the purpose of integrating multiple individual efforts into a coordinated and intentional regional network for offshore wind studies that addresses gaps in coverage. Develop maps that show the receiver network in the RWSC study area over time with attribution/contact information for receiver owners. Make maps, to a certain degree, available to the research community and public.\n\nIt is important to note how long each receiver will be in place, as there may be gaps for short term arrays.\nA priority is to identify critical locations for receiver arrays to be placed long term and identify funding institutions to purchase, deploy, and maintain the arrays.\n\nEnsure funding for sufficient human resources to support the development and maintenance of maps.\n\nCoordinate the co-location of receivers with other ocean-deployed sensors (e.g., with the RWSC Marine Mammal Subcommittee and regional IOOS associations).\nWork with researchers and industry to develop a reasonable time frame for data to be submitted.\n\nCreate process for requesting time extensions on data submission.\n\n\nCoordinate with national laboratories and other organizations to develop a database on all research regarding protected fish and offshore wind. Regions that are further behind (time-wise) in offshore wind development can use existing knowledge to advance technologies and practices to limit negative effects on protected fish.\nCompile existing data from the hydropower industry to see how all life stages of fish are impacted with particular emphasis on impingement and entrainment of the early life stages.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdams, T.P., Miller, R.G., Aleynik, D., Burrows, M.T., 2014.

    "text": "How to Use This Plan\nThe Executive Summary recommends actions that anyone, including state and federal agencies, offshore wind companies, environmental nonprofits, and researchers, can take to implement the Science Plan.\nAlthough government agencies participated in the development of the Science Plan, the document itself is not presently included in government regulations. Neither the RWSC nor any of its Subcommittees were established or are utilized by a federal agency for the purpose of obtaining advice or recommendations on issues or policies for any agency.\nThe U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), which is the lead permitting agency for offshore wind, has required2 that offshore wind projects follow the Data Management & Storage Best Practices for Long-term and Archival Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) Data developed by the RWSC Marine Mammal Subcommittee. These best practices were developed during the Science Plan development.\nSeveral states currently require offshore wind companies to fund regional research that is consistent with the Science Plan as part of their power purchase agreements. RWSC has set up an Offshore Wind & Wildlife Research Fund to pool together resources to help facilitate regional research that’s consistent with the Science Plan.\nRWSC will convene annual meetings to help states, industry, and other stakeholders to coordinate together around how they are and how they plan to fund offshore wind research.\nFor funds provided to RWSC, funding decisions will be advised by the expert Subcommittees and academics and ultimately reside with the Steering Committee, which is made up of representatives from government, industry, and non-governmental organizations."

    "text": "J 4     Data Management\nUnderstanding the full suite of oceanographic and meteorological processes near offshore wind developments will require close coordination among researchers, state and federal agencies, and industry.\nThe Habitat & Ecosystem Subcommittee recommends that consistent data collection methods are applied across studies of oceanographic and meteorological processes so that data can support regional-scale assessments and the development and maintenance of regional data products and tools (e.g., species distribution models).\nTo support these efforts, the Subcommittee recommends:\n·      Maintenance of an up-to-date resource list of recommended repositories, data and metadata standards, guidance, and protocols for use by all data collectors. The current recommended resources are detailed in the table below.\n·      Development of recommendations for managing, storing, accessing, and eventually compiling archived (i.e., not real-time) oceanographic and meteorological observations recorded by wildlife and habitat researchers (and others) that may not be appropriately submitted to any of the repositories below due to dataset size or other considerations (e.g., bottom temperature readings recorded during fall/spring bottom trawl surveys).\n·      Development of standard language for inclusion in requests for proposals and funding agreements to encourage or require the use of recommended repositories and data standards.\n·      Establishment of data sharing workflows, including formal agreements if necessary, to appropriately manage access to sensitive industry-collected datasets necessary for research (e.g., meteorological and oceanographic data collected on wind turbine generators and substations).\nThe following table lists the repositories and standards that are recommended for use in oceanographic and meteorological data collection.\nRecommended repositories and standards for oceanography data collection.\nThis science plan chapter identifies near-term investments for both field and non-field activities related to understanding and mitigating the potential regional and subregional oceanographic effects of offshore wind energy development. The main types of potential oceanographic effects that are discussed include considerations related to the physical effects of structures, noise propagation, water quality, and biological linkages. In terms of physical effects of wind energy structures, the potential physical effects both above and below the water surface are considered, including related to structures above the water extracting energy and structures in the water affecting turbulence and vertical mixing. In coordination with the taxa-based RWSC subcommittees’ recommendations, this chapter considered the noise and vibration that is generated by offshore wind turbines and associated operations, and developed recommendations specifically related to sound propagation and modeling. With respect to water quality, recommendations were developed to address the placement of wind turbine structures and associated effects on hydrodynamics that can in turn affect biogeochemical and water quality characteristics of the water column. Finally, in terms of linkages to biological effects, consideration was given to the introduction of new structures during offshore wind farm construction that can alter the habitat and modify food webs, including as the turbines are colonized.\nThis chapter develops a total of ~40 research recommendations that cover the five RWSC research themes. The recommendations are based on the ~75 individual ongoing data collection and research initiatives related to offshore wind and oceanographic/pelagic habitats and ecosystems funded by a variety of partners (states, federal agencies, industry). The recommendations were also informed by relevant research topics previously identified from the literature in the Atlantic Offshore Wind Environmental Research Recommendations Database that was filtered on habitat, oceanographic, phytoplankton, and zooplankton considerations. The Subcommittee discussed the importance of meteorological and oceanographic data as input to/drivers of species models (e.g., distribution, density, movement models). A key recommendation of the Subcommittee is to ensure that sufficient oceanographic data are collected to support species models and that those data are made available in the form of standardized data products that could be used by existing and future species modeling efforts."

    "section": "I.1 Background",
    "text": "I.1 Background\nA wealth of scientific information has been collected on the oceanography of U.S. Atlantic waters, setting the stage with a historical baseline for helping to understand future changes. At a high level, physical oceanographic processes are largely shaped by the Gulf Stream flowing north along the coast and the Labrador Current flowing south, with an abrupt transition occurring at Cape Hatteras where the Gulf Stream comes to within 30 km of shore (Townsend et al., 2006)( Figures 1-2). The Labrador Current transports cold water southward where it meets the shelf waters of the North Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf Stream at Cape Hatteras (Blair et al., 2022). The Gulf Stream flowing from the south contributes to heat redistribution in the North Atlantic and also influences the shelf ecosystem, particularly through the formation of meanders and eddies. Beyond these two major current systems, shelf water and slope water are distinct water masses that also influence the region. Shelf water has origins on the continental shelf and includes inputs from the multiple river systems along the coast. Thus, shelf water is less dense than slope waters which consist of a deep, nutrient rich water mass that lies between the shelf and the major offshore currents.\nFigure 1. The Northeast U.S. Continental Shelf ecosystem showing the dominant currents and oceanographic features.\nFigure 2. The U.S. South Atlantic marine ecosystem. Credit: NOAA/Seann Regan.\nVariability in regional atmospheric conditions impact sea surface properties (e.g., winds and temperature) and cause both short- and long-term changes in oceanographic processes along the Atlantic coast. Annual average wind speeds increase from the south and peak in New England and Gulf of Maine waters (Bodini et al., 2020; Musial et al., 2016). Winds fluctuate over multiple time scales including seasonally (with mid-latitudes generally higher in the summer), weekly (e.g., during synoptic-scale storms), daily (with higher winds at night), and hourly/sub-hourly (e.g., due to fluctuations in turbulence and gusts). At longer time scales, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) impacts the region and can be described in terms of an index value (NAOI) related to differences in sea level pressure, with patterns persisting across decades. The NAOI has been predominantly positive during the last several decades (NMFS, 2021), associated with an increase in westerly winds, an increase in precipitation, and warmer water temperatures for the eastern United States. By contrast, a negative NAOI is associated with a decrease in westerly winds, decreased storminess, drier conditions, and cooler water temperatures in the region.\nPrimary productivity in the region is determined by a physically dynamic ecosystem with complex interactions among environmental factors that influence the abundance, community composition, spatial distribution, and productivity of the phytoplanktonic communities. These environmental factors include the sunlight, nutrients, water temperature, physical processes (i.e., vertical mixing, upwelling, currents, and tides), and the feeding activity of zooplankton and shellfish(Blair et al., 2022). Water mass characteristics and oceanographic features (e.g., circulation patterns and frontal zone positions) are particularly important factors influencing phytoplankton patterns (Lipsky, 2020; NMFS, 2021). Seasonality greatly influences the dynamic ecosystem of the region, given that phytoplankton growth rates strongly correlate to temperature, light availability, and phytoplankton community size-structure (Marrec et al., 2021). Zooplankton graze on phytoplankton and are then prey for fish, crabs, whales, and other large organisms; biovolume (total volume of material caught in zooplankton nets) measurements have shown seasonal and interannual trends in the region (Blair et al., 2022).\n\nI.1.1 Oceanographic processes in the Atlantic region\n\nI.1.1.1 Historical and ongoing processes\nFrom north to south, each of the five regions described in this Science Plan have distinct oceanographic conditions and features. An overview of the oceanographic features in each region is provided in the following paragraphs.\nThe Gulf of Maine is a continental shelf sea with deep basins (e.g., Georges and Jordan Basins) that also includes the shallow offshore areas of Nantucket Shoals, Georges and Browns Banks, and the Scotian Shelf (Townsend et al., 2015). The Gulf reaches a maximum depth of over 1,200 feet in the Georges Basin. Inside the basins of the Gulf, tidal mixing as well as the seasonal warming and cooling of slope water and Scotian Shelf water create a seasonal intermediate layer, resulting in a three-layered water column structure. The shelf break front plays a role in structuring water masses which influences most trophic levels. Buoyancy-driven flow propels surface circulation in the Gulf and results in a counterclockwise direction due to freshwater riverine inputs and higher density offshore waters. Notably, the Gulf has among the greatest tidal ranges in the world and associated swift tidal currents. This tidal mixing strongly influences nutrient delivery to the euphotic zone and overall biological productivity. With its shallow and well-mixed waters, Georges Bank is unique for its high primary productivity and high concentrations of chlorophyll a, supporting an extensive food web including high levels of fish production (Northeast Integrated Ecosystem Assessment).\nSouthern New England waters extend from Cape Cod to Montauk Point, New York and include features such as Nantucket Shoals, Martha’s Vineyard, Block Island, and Long Island Sound, and submarine canyons in deeper waters (Blair et al., 2022). In the northern part of the region, the Great South Channel acts as a passage that connects the Gulf of Maine and the southern New England shelf. Nantucket Shoals are a well-mixed, shallow region and are biologically productive due to the cold, nutrient rich water arriving from the Gulf of Maine (Townsend et al., 2006). South of Martha’s Vineyard is an expanse of continental shelf with a gradual slope and cross-shelf currents leading to the edge of the shelf, where several submarine canyons cut into the shelf. To the south, Rhode Island Sound demonstrates seasonality of thermal stratification in the spring and summer. By contrast, Block Island Sound is an area with strong tidal currents and density stratification year-round. The greater-shelf region experiences warm core rings that break off from the Gulf Stream and the shelf break front plays a role in structuring water masses which influences most trophic levels. The northern portion of the Mid Atlantic Cold pool extends into southern New England waters.\nThe Mid-Atlantic Bight encompasses the entire Mid-Atlantic region, including the two RWSC subregions of the NY/NJ Bight (at its northern end) and the U.S. central Atlantic (at its southern end). The Mid-Atlantic region is influenced by both cool waters of the Labrador Current from the north and warm waters of the Gulf Stream from the south, with shelf water generally flowing south toward Cape Hatteras, North Carolina (Townsend et al., 2006). The New York Bight is a triangular feature that runs from Montauk at the eastern point of Long Island, New York to Cape May, New Jersey. Within the New York Bight, circulation is highly sensitive to changes in wind (Blumberg and Galperin, 1990) and biological productivity is affected by riverine nutrient outputs and cross-shelf interactions (Townsend et al., 2006). More broadly across the Mid-Atlantic Bight, the mixing of slope and shelf waters, along with upwelling, increases nutrient availability and promotes productivity(Townsend et al., 2006). The Mid-Atlantic Bight Cold Pool is a characteristic of the region, where strong seasonal stratification promotes productivity among all levels of the food chain; it is a dynamic feature that provides crucial habitat in the northeast shelf, particularly as a thermal refuge for benthic species(Blair et al., 2022).\nThe U.S. southeastern Atlantic is connected by the Loop Current-Florida Current-Gulf Stream continuum and influenced by the tropical and sub-tropical oceanic, atmospheric, and ecosystem domains. The confluence of the tropical and sub-tropical domains influences a range of sub-to super-regional physical and biogeochemical phenomena (SECOORA, 2019). In this region, the shelf is relatively wide and shallow; the physical dynamics are dominated by interactions with the Gulf Stream and the overlying atmosphere. Water movement is dominated by tidal and synoptic scale atmospheric events, and Gulf Stream frontal waves. Within Long Bay, situated in NC and SC, and other coastal bays, buoyancy also plays an important role in inner shelf oceanographic dynamics. In these areas, river plumes deliver sediment, nutrients, and pollutants to coastal waters, as well as also providing chemical cues that affect recruitment of estuarine-dependent fishery species. The dominant sources of nutrients for shelf waters are the circulation patterns influenced by meanders and frontal eddies. River plumes may also influence rates of coastal acidification in nearshore waters.\n\n\nI.1.1.2 Ongoing and future alterations due to climate change\nHuman-induced climate change is causing an increase in sea surface temperatures, sea level rise, and ocean acidification, and is changing circulation patterns (Blair et al., 2022). Over the last two decades, ocean temperatures in the northeast Atlantic Ocean have warmed faster than the global ocean on average, with the Gulf of Maine warming faster than 99% of the global ocean (Pershing et al., 2015). During this period, the Gulf Stream has moved northward, driving warmer, saltier water onto the northeast shelf, with a decrease in colder Labrador slope water entering the Gulf of Maine (Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council and New England Fishery Management Council 2022). Additionally, the size and position of the Mid-Atlantic Bight Cold Pool varies annually and is significantly smaller and less sustained during warmer years (Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council and New England Fishery Management Council 2022). Annual mean chlorophyll concentration trends across the northeast shelf and all subareas were steady from 1998 until 2012, at which point a downward trend persisted across the shelf through 2019 (Friedland et al., 2020). In the southeast region, the mean sea surface temperature between 2016 and 2021 was higher than 86% of the temperatures between 1985 and 2021; the average concentration levels of chlorophyll a between 2016 and 2021 were slightly lower than the long-term median of levels between 1998 and 2021.\n\n\n\nI.1.2 Potential effects to oceanography with respect to offshore wind\nThe main types of potential oceanographic effects due to offshore wind energy development are summarized in this section. They include considerations related to the physical effects of structures, noise propagation, water quality, and biological linkages.\nWind energy structures can have potential physical effects both above and below the water surface. The two primary components of these physical effects include: (1) structures above the water extracting energy, with associated wake effects (ocean-atmospheric interactions), and (2) structures in the water affecting turbulence and vertical mixing (hydrodynamic interactions). The extraction of energy has the potential to affect air-sea exchange processes, and associated changes in wind speeds, wave energy, turbulence, and eddy formation (Blair et al. 2022). For example, wake lengths of more than tens of kilometers under stable atmospheric conditions have been observed, with maximum wind speed deficits of 40%, and enhanced turbulence (Platis et al., 2018). In the water, the presence of turbine foundations can create localized friction, block ocean hydrodynamics, change wave amplitudes, and increase turbulent kinetic energy (van Berkel et al., 2020). Effects on hydrodynamics can cause lateral and vertical changes in the temperature and salinity profiles within the water column. These potential effects on water column mixing have implications for ocean stratification and the residence time of waters in a region. Consideration also needs to be given to the potential for energy extraction to affect upwelling, downwelling, and frontal zones, since these regions can aggregate prey and attract higher trophic level organisms.\nNoise and vibration are generated by offshore wind turbines and associated operations, with variation in the amount and quality of noise generated throughout the lifecycle of a wind farm (SEER, 2022a). For example, the installation of turbine foundations using monopiles is considered one of the noisiest aspects of wind farm construction due to pile driving activities, and opportunities exist to reduce the amount of noise and vibration produced during future offshore wind farm development (Green et al., 2023). Other wind farm related activities can also generate noise and vibration, including wind farm operations and support vessels for site assessment, as well as constructing, building and maintaining the wind turbines. The three main environmental factors that will affect undersea acoustic propagation include variability in pressure, temperature, and salinity, which produce changes in sound speed and consequently affect the characteristics of acoustic propagation (Lin et al., 2019). The effects of noise on marine mammals and sea turtles are discussed in separate chapters of this Science Plan. In addition to marine mammals and sea turtles, fish and invertebrate species can also be impacted by noise, including by particle motion (back-and-forth motion of the medium), sound pressure, and substrate vibration. The propagation or emission rates for these stressors are intrinsically dependent on the marine environmental conditions (Hogan and et al., 2023).\nThe placement of wind turbine structures and associated effects on hydrodynamics can in turn affect biogeochemical and water quality characteristics of the water column. In terms of turbidity, the turbulence created around a turbine foundation can result in increased sediment erosion and suspended sediment concentrations in the water column(van Berkel et al., 2020). As observed in satellite imagery, offshore turbine structures can increase near-surface suspended sediment concentrations in the form of turbid wakes(Vanhellemont and Ruddick, 2014). Suspended sediment concentrations can also affect light conditions with implications for phytoplankton growth in the water column. As well, any impacts of wind farms on hydrodynamics and mixing could also affect the vertical profiles of nutrient, oxygen, and chlorophyll concentrations within the water column, with implications for primary productivity and higher trophic levels(Blair et al., 2022).\nIn terms of linkages to biological effects, the introduction of new structures during offshore wind farm construction can alter the habitat and modify food webs as the turbines are colonized. Habitat can be temporarily or permanently altered directly beneath and in the vicinity of turbine foundations, depending on the foundation type, materials used, and sediment type(SEER, 2022b). Emplacement of structures, such as foundations, can alter habitat by introducing new hard surfaces into an environment of soft sediment, which are then rapidly colonized by epifaunal organisms. Through colonization, the structures can introduce a different community of organisms, which can cause changes in local primary production, alter the food web, change predator/prey relationships, and alter carbon flow to the benthos (Degraer, S. et al., 2020). Depending on the changes, the shifts have been considered both an enhancement of the environment (e.g., supporting local biodiversity) and a detriment (e.g., altering the local ecological system). Offshore wind farms have been observed to attract certain fish and invertebrate species to the turbine structures; these potential “artificial reef” effects refer to the ability of the structures to mimic characteristics of a natural reef (Carey, D.A. et al., 2020). Additionally, changes in flow patterns around wind farm foundations have been modeled to potentially affect larval transport pathways and settlement (Johnson, T et al., 2021).\n\n\nI.1.3 Platforms, environmental variables, models, and species model covariates\nThe Subcommittee discussed the importance of meteorological and oceanographic data as input to/drivers of species models (e.g., distribution, density, movement models). A key recommendation is to ensure that sufficient oceanographic data are collected to support species distribution and habitat suitability models and that those data are made available in the form of standardized data products. Some of the data products might be simple spatial interpolations; others are more complex models that may be covered in the subsection below the table. Covariates included in this list have also been informed by multiple existing modeling efforts (Hogan and et al., 2023; MDAT, 2017; Roberts et al., 2016).\nThe descriptions below are organized by variable, with notations related to potential platform(s), and whether or not the variable has been identified by the Subcommittee as a potentially important species model covariate.

    "text": "I.3 Oceanographic Data Collection & Analysis in U.S. Atlantic Waters\n\nI.3.1 Ongoing Oceanographic Data Collection and Analysis\nMany entities collect and manage physical and biological oceanographic and meteorological data in U.S. waters. These data and derived data products (e.g., hindcast, nowcast, and forecast model outputs) are produced and used by agencies and private entities for applications such as weather forecasting and maritime safety, in addition to research uses. One program within NOAA is the U.S. Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS), a national-regional partnership that coordinates the contributions of Federally owned observing and modeling systems and develops and integrates non-federal observing and modeling capacity into the system in partnership with IOOS regions. The IOOS Regional Associations (RAs) in the RWSC study area are the Southeast Coastal Ocean Observing Regional Association (SECOORA), the Mid-Atlantic Regional Association Coastal Ocean Observing System (MARACOOS), and the North East Regional Association of Coastal Ocean Observing Systems (NERACOOS). The Directors of each IOOS RA are members of the Habitat & Ecosystem Subcommittee, and IOOS RA staff also participate in each of the other RWSC Subcommittees. Each IOOS RA has different areas of focus with respect to data collection, synthesis, and management based on regional needs and partnerships. The IOOS RAs also coordinate coastal acidification networks along the Atlantic coast (SOCAN, MACAN, NECAN) whose activities should be leveraged with respect to understanding any biogeochemical effects resulting from construction and operation of offshore wind projects. Relevant IOOS RA biological data coordination is captured in each taxa-focused Science Plan chapter. IOOS RAs will coordinate through RWSC Subcommittees and with RWSC leadership on data collection, syntheses, and management with respect to offshore wind and wildlife studies. RWSC participants will also leverage the IOOS RAs extensive partnerships with the research community, and their educational and outreach activities.\nOceanographic and meteorological data collection is being collected within and around offshore wind leases given its inherent value to offshore wind developers to inform engineering and operational decisions. Several other entities are also funding, and/or advocating for oceanographic research and data collection activities with respect to offshore wind, in many cases due to the relevance to megafauna and their prey. Ongoing and planned activities are captured in the Offshore Wind & Wildlife Research Database.\n\n\nI.3.2 Recommended Oceanographic Data Collection and Analysis\nEntities that deploy platforms to collect oceanographic and meteorological data in and near offshore wind development sites should coordinate with the IOOS RAs to manage and disseminate those data, in real-time, as is feasible. Links to where those data can be accessed should be shared with the RWSC Habitat & Ecosystem Subcommittee as soon as possible. Several offshore wind developers have or are actively coordinating with the IOOS RAs to serve real-time oceanographic and meteorological data from platforms within their lease areas approved by BOEM as part of their Site Assessment Plans. Links below point to active or legacy data:\n·       Beacon Wind (Equinor)\n·       Empire Wind (Equinor)\n·       Atlantic Shores Offshore Wind\n·       SouthCoast Wind\nThe Subcommittee recommends the following data collection activities :\n·       Leverage, maintain awareness, and coordinate with existing data collection programs that characterize baseline hydrodynamic and oceanographic processes, including:\no   Long-term surveys, datasets, and syntheses that inform the NOAA Fisheries State of the Ecosystem Reports Northeast U.S. Shelf (updated annually) and the Northeast Integrated Ecosystem Assessment.\no   Coastal Data Information Program (CDIP)\no   National Data Buoy Center (NDBC)\no   U.S. IOOS High Frequency Radar Network\no   National Water Level Observation Network (NWLON)\no   Datasets routinely collected by other agencies, including the National Weather Service, U.S. Navy, and others.\n·       Collect oceanographic (and for above-water species, meteorological) data simultaneously to wildlife observation data collection activities to provide context and understand potential drivers of wildlife distribution, abundance, behavior, movement, and health.\no   Leverage existing IOOS RA infrastructure, including co-locating sensors.\no   A list of key oceanographic and meteorological variables, parameters, and platforms/methods is provided in the Appendix. Many of these variables are recognized by the Global Ocean Observing System as Essential Ocean Variables (EOV). The list also specifies whether the variable was identified by RWSC Subcommittees as a potentially useful covariate for species distribution modeling (Hogan et al., 2023; MDAT, 2017; Roberts et al., 2016).\no   Ensure that oceanographic/meteorological data collected during offshore wind and wildlife surveys/studies is compiled and made available for use in other analyses and research.\n·       Collect meteorological, hydrographic, oceanographic, and productivity data in a consistent way from the fine- to regional scales to informs models (see Data Analysis) and produce a collection of standardized data products for priority species modeling covariates:\no   See the list of key variables, parameters, and platforms/methods in the Appendix.\no   Ensure that hydrodynamic and oceanographic processes are consistently measured across the RWSC study area.\no   Processes of interest for which data should be collected for modeling (training and validation) include:\n§  Mid-Atlantic cold pool formation; stratification in general\n§  Local turbulence production and induced mixing of different offshore wind foundation structures\n§  Water quality and light penetration (e.g., chemical contamination associated with increased vessel traffic and presence of offshore wind structures, effects on suspended particulate matter and turbidity)\n§  Atmospheric effects associated with energy removal by wind turbines (e.g., wake effects, the effects on waves, currents, and other air-sea interactions)\n§  Wind farm-induced flow and atmospheric response to both momentum and heat fluxes\n§  Ambient soundscapes and sound propagation data\n§  Phytoplankton composition/biomass/abundance, primary productivity, and change over time; occurrence and persistence of harmful algal blooms\n§  Zooplankton composition/biomass/abundance, secondary productivity, and change over time\n§  Food availability for filter feeders and links to higher trophic levels\no   Where appropriate, using observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs) to determine optimal location of oceanographic observing at the region-wide scale.\n§  Coordinate with the IOOS RAs and RWSC Subcommittees that may be deploying instrumentation via buoys to strategically co-locate sensors for oceanographic, meteorological, and habitat data.\n§  Investing in region wide data collection with AUVs and remote sensing, including gliders, to supplement buoy data and collect more seamless broad scale coverage of physical oceanographic and biogeochemical data, and to record ambient noise.\no   Identify reliable reference/control sites, which may also be areas of high ecosystem productivity, for long-term monitoring and baseline data collection of multiple oceanographic variables in areas outside of wind lease areas.\n·       Advance technologies that facilitate widespread oceanographic and meteorological data collection, transmission, and data management during all phases of offshore wind development, and to ensure that the performance of new technologies is evaluated consistently (see Technology chapter recommendations).\no   Develop, test, and validate novel platforms for collecting oceanographic and meteorological data\no   Leverage existing and improve real-time data transmission technologies from offshore platforms (cost, availability, reliability)\n\nI.3.2.1 Gulf of Maine recommendations\nGaps in assessing the potential impacts of hydrodynamic and atmospheric alterations on physical and biological resources in the northeast have been identified and apply to the Gulf of Maine region (Blair et al. 2022). Determining oceanographic baselines and competing phenomena, such as the impacts of climate change, in addition to effects of offshore wind development is a research need. Characterizing hydrodynamic and atmospheric alterations due to offshore wind development is another broad research need related to future offshore wind development in the Gulf of Maine. Detecting the influence of scale and collecting information on cumulative impacts has emerged as a priority research topic in recent years. Monitoring of offshore wind projects sites in the Gulf of Maine will need to be conducted to increase understanding of marine ecology and oceanographic impacts. There are currently very few federal ocean observing buoys collecting data in the Gulf of Maine planning area, and the numbers of buoys in the planning area should be increased to understand baselines and effects from offshore wind development (Figure 4).\nFigure 4. Federal ocean observing buoys and stations in the Gulf of Maine subregion. (Source: Northeast Ocean Data Portal)\nFollowing are some examples of more specific research that needs to be conducted to assess the potential oceanographic effects of future offshore wind buildout in the Gulf of Maine.\n·      Measure the atmospheric effects associated with energy removal by future wind turbines in the region. This could be performed using instrumentation and modeling similar to the Wind Forecasting Improvement Project 3 (WFIP-3) which is being conducted in the MA/RI lease areas.\n·      Establish a Lidar buoy program in the Gulf of Maine similar to programs in other areas along the U.S. Atlantic (e.g., MA, NJ, VA). The buoy(s) would measure wind profile, speed and direction; solar radiation; air temperature and relative humidity; barometric pressure; water velocity, salinity and temperature; wave spectrum.\n·      Conduct glider-based ecological and oceanographic surveys along optimized transects in the Gulf of Maine. These surveys would be similar to what is currently being conducted in the New York Bight and could be an extension of glider surveys previously conducted in the Gulf of Maine as part of the project “Optimizing Ocean Acidification Observations for Model Parameterization in the Coupled Slope Water System of the U.S. Northeast Large Marine Ecosystem”. The glider surveys would capture the seasonal variability with simultaneous oceanographic and ecological sampling. The sensor suite on each glider would characterize the ecosystem’s physical structure (Temperature, Salinity, Density; CTD), tagged fish presence (Vemco receiver), and marine mammal presence (passive acoustics; DMON).\n·      Expand monitoring of soundscapes in the Gulf of Maine to collect background data and to measure noise from potential offshore wind development in the region. There is a gap in sound data collection in the northern part and deeper waters of the Gulf of Maine (see https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/maps/passive-acoustic-data/).\n·      Similar to the way RODEO has been performed in other regions, acquire real-time observations of the construction and initial operation of wind facilities to aid the evaluation of environmental effects of future facilities. Measurements should be made of: pile driving sound & operational sound (PAM), particle motion, cable layer, scour monitoring, seafloor disturbance and recovery, benthic habitat changed, epifouling, and fish.\n·      Before any turbines are installed then after construction, collect field measurements to understand how the placement of wind turbine structures and associated effects on hydrodynamics can in turn affect biogeochemical and water quality characteristics of the water column.\n·      Improve and expand the forecasting capabilities of the Northeast Coastal Ocean Forecast System (NECOFS) with relevance to understanding the potential effects of offshore wind development on oceanographic processes in the Gulf of Maine.\n·      Work together with NERACOOS to expand engagement with key end users in the offshore wind development and oceanographic communities to clearly identify how data and information can best be provided to suit their needs, refine the technical approach, and verify that user needs are met.\n\n\nI.3.2.2 Southern New England Recommendations\nFollowing are some examples of more specific research that needs to be conducted to assess the potential oceanographic effects of future offshore wind buildout in the Southern New England subregion.\n·      Determine oceanographic baselines and competing phenomena, such as the impacts of climate change, in addition to effects of offshore wind development. With adjoining lease areas in the MA/RI area, it will be important to understand the oceanographic effects of multiple wind farms and their cumulative impacts. There are currently very few federal ocean observing buoys collecting data in the MA/RI lease areas, and the numbers of buoys in these areas should be increased to understand baselines and effects from offshore wind development (Figure 5).\n·      The PIONEER array collected data from the inshore and shelf area to examine exchanges between the shelf and slope and the shelf ecosystem, as well as to provide broader insight into air-sea gas exchange, including carbon dioxide absorption. The array’s first deployment was off the coast of New England at the Continental Shelf/Slope interface, where it collected data from 2016 until it was recovered in September 2022; the array is now being moved to the southern Mid-Atlantic Bight (or RWSC Central Atlantic subregion). Given the time series of oceanographic data collected by the PIONEER array in New England waters, a new sampling program should be initiated to continue this time series and to expand measurements to those needed most for understanding potential effects of offshore wind development in New England waters.\n·      During 2023-2026, post-construction wildlife surveys will be performed by BOEM outside of the MA WEA adjacent to Vineyard Wind 1. These surveys should include collection of oceanographic and habitat covariates to understand potential effects of windfarm development on above and below water processes.\n·      Similar to how RODEO was performed at Block Island wind farm, perform similar types of monitoring during construction of other wind farms in the region to understand potential effects on oceanography, habitat, and colonization of foundations. Consideration should be given to monitoring of effects using different mitigation measures (such as for sound propagation) during construction to understand best approaches for minimizing environmental effects.\n·      Collect field measurements to understand how the placement of wind turbine structures and associated effects on hydrodynamics can in turn affect biogeochemical and water quality characteristics of the water column.\n·      Based on methodology for WFIP-3, develop a guidance document for how similar types of field programs could be implemented in other regions. The program is unique in terms of implementing a comprehensive observational and modeling study of the coupled atmospheric and oceanic boundary layers in and around offshore wind farms and would be applicable to other subregions where wind farms are being developed.\nFigure 5. Federal ocean observing buoys and stations in the Southern New England subregion. (Source: Northeast Ocean Data Portal)\n\n\nI.3.2.3 New York/New Jersey Bight Recommendations\nFollowing are some examples of more specific research that needs to be conducted to assess the potential oceanographic effects of future offshore wind buildout in the New York/New Jersey Bight subregion.\n·      Determine oceanographic baselines and competing phenomena, such as the impacts of climate change, in addition to effects of offshore wind development. With adjoining lease areas, especially off the New Jersey coast, it will be important to understand the oceanographic effects of multiple wind farms and their cumulative impacts. There are currently very few federal ocean observing buoys collecting data in the New York/New Jersey Bight lease areas, and the numbers of buoys in these areas should be increased to understand baselines and effects from offshore wind development (Figure 6).\n·      Similar to how RODEO was performed at Block Island wind farm, perform similar types of monitoring during construction of other wind farms in the region to understand potential effects on oceanography, habitat, and colonization of foundations. Consideration should be given to monitoring of effects using different mitigation measures (such as for sound propagation) during construction to understand best approaches for minimizing environmental effects.\n·      Collect field measurements to understand how the placement of wind turbine structures and associated effects on hydrodynamics can in turn affect biogeochemical and water quality characteristics of the water column.\n·      Ensure coordination between RWSC and MARACOOS (which includes the NY/NJ Bight subregion) to spearhead data collection, archival, and sharing according to industry standards.\n·      Work together with MARACOOS to expand engagement with key end users in the offshore wind development and oceanographic communities to clearly identify how data and information can best be provided to suit their needs, refine the technical approach, and verify that user needs are met.\nFigure 6. Federal ocean observing buoys and stations in the New York/New Jersey Bight subregion. (Source: Northeast Ocean Data Portal)\n\n\n\nI.3.3 U.S. Central Atlantic Recommendations\nFollowing are some examples of more specific research that needs to be conducted to assess the potential oceanographic effects of future offshore wind buildout in the U.S. Central Atlantic subregion.\n·      Determine oceanographic baselines and competing phenomena, such as the impacts of climate change, in addition to effects of offshore wind development. With multiple draft WEAs in the U.S. Central Atlantic, on both the shelf and in deeper waters, it will be important to understand the oceanographic effects of multiple wind farms and their cumulative impacts. There are currently very few federal ocean observing buoys collecting data in deeper waters of this subregion; the numbers of buoys should be increased to understand baselines and effects from offshore wind development (Figure 7).\n·      Measure the atmospheric effects associated with energy removal by future wind turbines in the region. This could be performed using instrumentation and modeling similar to the Wind Forecasting Improvement Project 3 (WFIP-3) that is being conducted in the MA/RI lease areas.\n·      Similar to the way RODEO has been performed, acquire real-time observations of the construction and initial operation of wind facilities to aid the evaluation of environmental effects of future facilities. Measurements should be made of: pile driving sound & operational sound (PAM), particle motion, cable layer, scour monitoring, seafloor disturbance and recovery, benthic habitat changed, epifouling, and fish.\n·      Before any turbines are installed and after construction, collect field measurements to understand how the placement of wind turbine structures and associated effects on hydrodynamics can in turn affect biogeochemical and water quality characteristics of the water column. Biogeochemical and biological sensors could be added to existing and future moorings and buoys.\n·      Ensure coordination between RWSC and MARACOOS (which includes the U.S. Central Atlantic subregion) to spearhead data collection, archival, and sharing according to industry standards.\n·      Work together with MARACOOS to expand engagement with key end users in the offshore wind development and oceanographic communities to clearly identify how data and information can best be provided to suit their needs, refine the technical approach, and verify that user needs are met.\nFigure 7. Federal ocean observing buoys and stations in the U.S. Central Atlantic subregion. (Source: Northeast Ocean Data Portal)\n\n\nI.3.4 U.S. Southeast Atlantic Recommendations\nFollowing are some examples of more specific research that needs to be conducted to assess the potential oceanographic effects of future offshore wind buildout in the U.S. Southeast Atlantic subregion.\n·      Determine oceanographic baselines and competing phenomena, such as the impacts of climate change, in addition to effects of offshore wind development. With currently only two, but adjoining, lease areas proposed in the northern area of the subregion, it will be important to understand the oceanographic effects of multiple wind farms and their cumulative impacts. There are currently very few federal ocean observing buoys collecting data in these lease areas, and the numbers of buoys in the whole U.S. Southeast Atlantic subregion should be increased to understand baselines and effects from offshore wind development (Figure 8). Especially, buoys and coastal stations are needed on the east coast of FL, within the 10-50 meter isobaths.\n·      Measure the atmospheric effects associated with energy removal by future wind turbines in the region. This could be performed using instrumentation and modeling similar to the Wind Forecasting Improvement Project 3 (WFIP-3) that is being conducted in the MA/RI lease areas.\n·      Add high frequency radar stations to fill coverage gaps identified in the subregion.\n·      Establish a Lidar buoy program in the U.S. southeastern Atlantic similar to programs in other areas along the U.S. Atlantic (e.g., MA, NJ, VA). The buoy(s) would measure wind profile, speed and direction; solar radiation; air temperature and relative humidity; barometric pressure; water velocity, salinity and temperature; wave spectrum.\n·      Expand monitoring of soundscapes in the U.S. Southeast Atlantic to collect background data and to measure noise from potential offshore wind development in the region. There is a gap in sound data collection in the shallower waters of the subregion (see https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/maps/passive-acoustic-data/). In addition, fishery independent research programs in the subregion (MARMAP and SEAMAP) could be leveraged to deploy hydrophones in areas where surveys occur.\n·       Similar to the way RODEO has been performed in other regions, acquire real-time observations of the construction and initial operation of wind facilities to aid the evaluation of environmental effects of future facilities. Measurements should be made of: pile driving sound & operational sound (PAM), particle motion, cable layer, scour monitoring, seafloor disturbance and recovery, benthic habitat changed, epifouling, and fish.\n·      Before any turbines are installed then after construction, collect field measurements to understand how the placement of wind turbine structures and associated effects on hydrodynamics can in turn affect biogeochemical and water quality characteristics of the water column. Biogeochemical and biological sensors could be added to existing and future moorings and buoys.\n·      Ensure coordination between RWSC and to spearhead data collection, archival, and sharing according to industry standards.\n·      Work together with SECOORA to expand engagement with key end users in the offshore wind development and oceanographic communities to clearly identify how data and information can best be provided to suit their needs, refine the technical approach, and verify that user needs are met.\n·      Identify historical data in the U.S. Southeast Atlantic subregion that needs to be preserved, as well as a pathway to collect, compile, and preserve historical data.\n·      Develop high-resolution coupled physical-biogeochemical models incorporating as many marine environmental variables as relevant to offshore wind development and the various U.S. Southeast Atlantic ecosystems (e.g., coral reefs).\n·      Leverage SECOORA’s education and outreach efforts to develop public engagement campaigns related to ocean observation technologies and offshore wind effects.\nFigure 8.
