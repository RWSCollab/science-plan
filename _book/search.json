    "text": "Summary of Subcommittee Recommendations\nThis section consolidates the detailed recommendations made by each Subcommittee in the Science Plan to address data gaps and needs. Each Subcommittee’s chapter provides more information about the geographies where certain activities should occur, ecological and logistical considerations for implementing recommendations, and the entities who are leading existing work. The Sector Caucuses expect that to implement these recommendations, many different science entities may take on roles to fund, guide, or otherwise support the work needed to address the recommendations based on an entity’s expertise, capacity, and existing data collection, research, and data management portfolio.\n\nLeverage the substantial existing data management infrastructure within the federal government and private sector. Ensure that agencies and entities responsible for managing and funding existing repositories coordinate via RWSC to understand capacity needs and usability given the volume of offshore wind and wildlife data being collected.\nApply consistent data collection, QA/QC, data management, data storage, and data sharing guidance for all offshore wind and wildlife studies, as developed or recommended by each Subcommittee.\nEstablish specific collaboratives, data sharing agreements, and tools for offshore wind companies, contractors, and researchers to appropriately access key industry-collected datasets for use in decision-making and research.\nFund data collection and research tailored to the mix of species present and the need for baseline data in each subregion, according to each chapter in the Science Plan.\n\nEncourage new data collection activities to align with the objectives of the NOAA Fisheries and BOEM Federal Survey Mitigation Strategy.\nContinue baseline data collection for all species in all geographies and improve collection for species that are relatively data-poor, including all sea turtles, bats, and protected fish species. Monitor species’ movement in, and use of, wind energy areas consistently across the region.\nBaseline data collection should continue in the Gulf of Maine, U.S. Central Atlantic, and U.S. Southeast Atlantic where construction is likely a few years away. To understand potential impacts from the construction of the first commercial-scale developments in Southern New England and New York/New Jersey Bight, conduct project-level studies using consistent methods and approaches.\nEncourage consistent methods and approaches to all individual data collection, data analysis, and data management efforts to support regional scale assessments and the development and maintenance of regional data products and tools.\n\nContinue to the lead coordination of research planning, data collection, data analysis, and data management for wildlife surveys and sensor networks throughout the study area funded by multiple entities that benefit from regional collaboration:\n\nLong-term archival passive acoustic monitoring for marine mammal monitoring and soundscape characterization.\nMotus (radio telemetry) receiver network and tagging efforts for birds and bats.\nAcoustic telemetry receiver network and tagging efforts for sea turtles and protected fish species.\nRepeated, regular, high-definition aerial photography surveys that cover multiple contiguous and proximate lease areas and characterize multiple taxa.\nSeafloor habitat data compilation, the identification of sensitive hard bottom and coral habitats, and the development of regional-scale habitat maps.\nDeployment of multi-sensor oceanographic and ecological buoys in areas of high biodiversity and/or habitat value.\nConsistent performance evaluation of new technologies for mitigation and long-term monitoring of protected species.\n\nOptimize the design of surveys and sensor networks to detect broad scale species displacement, changes in abundance, and/or changes in behavior using power analyses or other statistical tools.\nContinue to update existing species distribution models (marine mammals, seabirds, sea turtles) and develop new models with the latest at-sea observations, movement data, and environmental data every 2-3 years. Produce and keep updated a standardized set of regional seafloor habitat and oceanographic data products for use as covariates in species distribution modeling and other analyses.\nAs per the National Academies of Sciences recommendations, conduct oceanographic observations and modeling to differentiate changes to hydrodynamics from climate change and offshore wind development at turbine, windfarm, and broader scales.\nExpand on and link existing studies of prey species, including plankton, across the Atlantic to establish a broader ecosystem wide observing system that can detect patterns, trends, and trophic linkages.\nFor studies of potential impacts, follow existing guidance and best practices for study design and analysis compiled by the Subcommittees for consistency and leverage the opportunity to combine individual studies into broader regional scale analyses.\nAdvance technologies to improve wildlife detection and impact mitigation and ensure consistent technology performance evaluation."

    "section": "Implementing the Science Plan – a Framework for Collaboration",
    "text": "Implementing the Science Plan – a Framework for Collaboration\nTo ensure that the data collection and research efforts recommended in the Science Plan are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable2 by anyone, the four Sectors have developed a voluntary framework for collaboration through RWSC. This framework has three primary goals:\n\nCoordinate regional research on offshore wind and wildlife through the RWSC, regardless of funding source, recipient(s), or funding structure.\nEnsure that data collection and research methods and products meet the needs of decision-makers, are scientifically sound, standardized, and are made available for use as soon as possible to inform and improve decision-making.\nCommunicate the impact of individual and collaborative research.\n\nThe four sectors welcome and encourage participation from all entities and individuals in implementing this Science Plan, especially via expert Subcommittee meetings3. To assist in the implementation of the Science Plan, the RWSC will maintain the Offshore Wind & Wildlife Research Database and continue to provide tools and forums for research planning, discussions, and collaboration among all participants. All are encouraged to participate in implementing the Science Plan by:\n\nMaintaining situational awareness of data collection and research activities to identify opportunities for collaboration, consistency, and efficiency. This can be accomplished in part by participating regularly in RWSC Sector Caucus and expert Subcommittee meetings and by requiring relevant grantees, contractors, and researchers to share project information with the RWSC. Several RWSC participants have noted the value of Subcommittee meetings as forums for sharing research plans, discussing emerging issues, and working together across sectors to advance Science Plan objectives. The Subcommittees will continue to meet regularly to share information on the latest study results, ongoing and planned research and data collection, and to periodically review data management infrastructure needs and workflows. Entities will consult with the relevant RWSC Subcommittee(s), as appropriate, prior to new data collection (to ensure consistency and reduce duplication) and analysis (to facilitate access to the available data) and share detail about where and when activities take place to avoid conflicts. RWSC will facilitate this objective via the Offshore Wind & Wildlife Research Database, web mapping tools, and a data catalog (in development).\nCollaboratively implementing and requiring the use of best practices for data collection, QA/QC, data management and storage as specified in this Science Plan. Each Subcommittee has recommended or required practices for each relevant data type or data collection method in the Science Plan. To encourage uptake and consistent use of these practices, the RWSC will provide suggested language, agreed to by the Sector Caucuses, around data management and sharing for participants to use in their own requests for proposals and agreements.\nParticipating in regular discussion and adaptation of research priorities. RWSC provides a forum for partners to identify data and research needs based on current data gaps, new research results, emerging decision-making needs, and available funding. To facilitate an adaptive approach to prioritizing the recommendations in the Science Plan, RWSC will convene the sectors annually to review and discuss funding priorities. Discussions will be informed by the expert Subcommittees’ work, collaborative workshops, and agreed upon prioritization criteria.\nAligning funds and developing collaborative funding plans. Coordination through the Subcommittees and during annual funding strategy sessions provides opportunities for participants to align funds to address Science Plan objectives and ensure consistency with agency science plans and guidance. RWSC provides the mechanisms for pooling funds to accomplish shared priorities when practical.\n\nThe four sectors will reassess the Science Plan and framework for collaboration every five years to ensure its continued utility and relevance in light of new information and changes in the rapidly evolving offshore wind industry. The RWSC will track progress on Science Plan recommendations annually.\nThe four sectors also envision and welcome uses of this Science Plan for purposes other than their direct coordination on offshore wind and wildlife data collection and research in U.S. Atlantic waters:\n\nThe Science Plan and its development process can be used as an example for regional offshore wind science entities in other geographies.\nThe greater scientific community can use this plan to shape their own research objectives and inform their funding decisions related to offshore wind and wildlife efforts.\nThe RWSC Science Plan could be used to support multi-sector collaborations to advance career workforce development programs for ecological and biological monitoring roles by serving as a guide to identify the scientific disciplines, the types of roles and the skills (including the educational requirements) necessary to address the research questions4. Building on the administration’s Justice40 objectives and state-level commitments, the STEM ecological and biological career workforce investments should be targeted to benefit communities historically underrepresented in the scientific community that have been most impacted by environmental harms by developing a Bluegreen Career Map with multiple training and employment entry and exit points."

To accommodate this fact, the ecological focus of the Science Plan includes all habitats occupied by the species under study.

    "section": "Summary",
    "text": "Summary\nData governance and data management are essential to achieving the RWSC’s goals and the research described in this Science Plan. Data governance encompasses the purpose and processes for collecting and using data, policies such as contract terms and data licenses, and frameworks for technical implementation. Data management executes and informs data governance, supporting the shared goals and agreements with standards, best practices, documentation, and infrastructure. The two practices are complementary and need to operate in tandem, in ways that are responsive to program demands and the capacity of the RWSC community.\nDuring the 2023 Science Plan review, the RWSC held multiple discussions on data governance and management, including a half-day workshop on September 8, 2023. As a result of these discussions, as well as comments received on the draft Science Plan, parts of the original Data Management Chapter have been distributed into relevant Subcommittee chapters while other parts are now incorporated here. This reflects a general desire to divide roles and responsibilities between the RWSC Steering Committee (via a newly created Data Governance Subcommittee) and the expert Subcommittees such that:\n\nThe Data Governance Subcommittee (DGSC) oversees issues that cross disciplines and taxa, like common data sharing terms for contracts, tools for sharing sensitive data, requirements for RWSC-funded projects, or setting a “floor” for data to be included in the RWSC catalog.\nOther Subcommittees and data leads for individual projects hold the primary responsibility for data management of project data and data workflows. This includes applying the recommendations in the Subcommittee chapters for metadata standards, preferred repositories, and data stewardship through the data lifecycle.\n\nThis chapter focuses on the role of data governance and management across projects and Subcommittees—at the RWSC DGSC level—and describes how both the DGSC and other Subcommittees might each advance these efforts. More detailed information on data management for specific data types can be found in each of the Subcommittee chapters, including recommendations for study design, data collection sheet standardization, and other taxa- or method-specific data standards.\nThe RWSC Steering Committee will set up a Data Governance Subcommittee (DGSC) by Spring 2024. The initial scope of work for that group will include:\n\nMapping the offshore wind & wildlife data ecosystem\nDeveloping common policies, minimum data standards, and guidance for data management\nCreating a data catalog\nBuilding network capacity to steward unique or orphaned data\nProviding general data governance support and education\n\nOnce established, the DGSC should refine these goals and develop a workplan for the first year, focusing on tasks that are essential, have high levels of demand, or where DGSC efforts can have high impact. Data governance and management are applicable to every RWSC participant. The remainder of this chapter provides guidance and resources for both the DGSC and anyone looking to implement data governance and management."

    "section": "2.1 Introduction to Data Governance & Management",
    "text": "2.1 Introduction to Data Governance & Management\nFor more background and context, read the Data Governance & Data Management Appendix.\nThe RWSC’s mission is:\n\n“To collaboratively and effectively conduct and coordinate relevant, credible, and efficient regional monitoring and research of wildlife and marine ecosystems that supports the advancement of environmentally responsible and cost-efficient offshore wind power development activities in U.S. Atlantic waters.”\n\nAchieving this mission requires attention to the way monitoring is carried out, by whom, and how results are validated and shared. Delivering efficiencies and coordinating data from collection to research products, across diverse and widespread efforts, will require data governance and management. Well-planned data governance will also help position the RWSC as a trusted resource for research guidance and information.\nData governance focuses on how decisions are made about data and how people and processes are expected to behave in relation to data, including configuring technical infrastructure (Sebastian-Coleman, 2018). Data governance can be created through international agreements, national laws, or implemented at an organizational or project level (Brous et al., 2016; MacFeely et al., 2022). Well-designed data governance supports effective, privacy-protecting data sharing and increases the value and impact of data through access and reuse (Abraham et al., 2019). This is particularly important for environmental data efforts (Fritzenkötter et al., 2022), like the RWSC, where analyses could involve data from a wide range of sources, such as compliance data shared with government agencies, data collected by wind energy companies and their contractors, independent and academic researchers, nonprofit organizations, and other future collaborators. Each of these contributors needs to be confident in how their data will be used and have the capacity to make informed decisions about data sharing, understanding both the potential benefits and risks.\nData governance and management are important to consider at every step of the data lifecycle1. The Science Plan lays out research goals which rely on collaboration across a network of partners and projects. Each of these partnerships and projects may be at a different stage of their data lifecycle. Science Plan participants shared examples of data flows where there was a lack of clarity about how data would be structured or transmitted, inconsistent documentation of data practices, and questions about whether partners had the right agreements in place to allow data sharing. These are the types of questions data governance and management can answer, and the ideal time to discuss these topics is before data collection starts. This is why it is critical for the DGSC and other Subcommittees to coordinate on data governance and management, connecting the project-level guidance in the Subcommittee chapters to the broader data integration work of the DGSC.\nU.S. federal agencies, Atlantic coast states, and offshore wind companies are all funding individual data collection and research activities. Some of these activities are conducted collaboratively but the majority are funded, scoped, and managed under the purview of a single funder or entity. In its role as a coordinator, the RWSC can provide guidance and support for consistency across data efforts and partners, including sharing standards and best practices such as New York’s Wildlife Data Standardization and Sharing report (NYSERDA, 2021).\nCollaboration takes time and resources, and it is essential to the success of the Science Plan. By planning for data governance and management at the RWSC level, not just at the individual research project level, the RWSC can identify where best to invest time and resources to achieve the collective goals of the offshore wind and wildlife community. The RWSC can continue its approach of operating transparently by documenting how tools were chosen, how often templates or protocols will be revised, and other decisions about data. Being open about how these decisions are made builds trust in the data systems used by the RWSC and the data products produced (Lin et al., 2020). Finally, program-level data governance and management can create efficiencies and incentives, like improving data discoverability and access, reducing duplicative research, or increasing the visibility of RWSC science so funders and researchers get citable “credit” for their work generating data and data products."

    "section": "2.2 Implementing Data Governance & Management",
    "text": "2.2 Implementing Data Governance & Management\nThe DGSC will be the primary home for data governance in the RWSC. The recommendations below form an initial scope for the work of the DGSC. Once established, the DGSC should refine its scope and workplan with an eye on:\n\nWhat is absolutely essential (e.g., guidance for RWSC-supported projects, minimum data standards to make a data catalog operational).\nWhat has high levels of demand (e.g., templates for contract and policy language).\nWhere RWSC has unique value (e.g., enabling sharing of sensitive data).\nWhat has high impact (e.g., removes a critical data bottleneck).\n\n\n1 - Mapping the offshore wind & wildlife data ecosystem\nThe offshore wind and wildlife data ecosystem encompasses all the data necessary to answer the questions in the RWSC Science Plan; the agencies, organizations, and individuals that created the data; the data hosts or locations; and the networks that connect them. A data ecosystem’s interconnections are core to its value. If data discovery is difficult or data cannot move from one node to another, the data ecosystem will not be as effective or efficient. Figure 1 provides a high-level concept of the data ecosystem and how elements could be connected to deliver Science Plan products, with a focus on data sources, ownership, and control.\nDGSC roles:\n\nLead development of the data ecosystem map.\nReview data flows described in Subcommittee chapters and request additional information from Subcommittee leads and partners as needed.\nIdentify common bottlenecks or barriers across data types and sources that could be addressed by consistent guidance, policy, workflows, or other tools from the RWSC.\nEncourage repositories in the data ecosystem to adopt a consistent Atlantic offshore wind “identifier” for data collected in and around Atlantic WEAs.\nConsider how the existing RWSC database of relevant research activities and the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic Ocean Data Portals fit into the data ecosystem now, and how those entities might play different roles once the data catalog is created.\n\nSubcommittee roles:\n\nIdentify issues around data flows, interoperability across platforms, and general data access for the DGSC to consider.\nUpdate and maintain documentation on data standards and preferred repositories and provide summaries to DGSC.\nSupport data partners in documenting data flows and identifying barriers and challenges.\n\n\n\n2 - Developing common policies, minimum data standards, and guidance for data management\n\nCommon policies\nRWSC participants expressed strong support for a common library of contract language and guidance on data licensing. While individual repositories may have their own licensing terms, including adding machine-readable license terms to datasets, the DGSC can look across these licensing terms in their repository review and highlight commonalities. Similarly, RWSC staff have already begun compiling data sharing and licensing terms from RWSC partners and from Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) like the MOU between RWSC and the Center for Ocean Leadership to administer research funding. The language library can help partners select the most appropriate terms for their data needs. The DGSC can also explore creating a basic data sharing policy that can be incorporated by reference in any contract.\n\n\nData standards and data management\n“Ensuring appropriate data and standards are in place to support science priorities” is part of the RWSC’s core purpose. At the September 2023 RWSC Data Governance workshop, participants were interested in common standards for: metadata across agencies, sectors, and groups; attribution; data management; data collection methods; long-term storage; and data quality. This is an area where there is a high degree of interest and expertise in the RWSC community, as well as strong opinions about the merits of different tools and approaches. Standardizing data and data processes has many benefits:\n\nReduced cost for funders of research: funders can reference standard practices rather than spending time detailing them in a scope of work or updating study requirements as science and research technologies advance.\nReduced cost/time for data collectors: researchers can use and cite standard practices rather than developing new protocols and avoid collecting unnecessary or incompatible data.\nEnsures a standard product: funders can be sure that they paid for “good” data that met a set of community-developed criteria; data can be used in future analyses.\nMore efficient science and management decision-making: access and analyses are faster which streamlines interpretation and use.\n\nThe RWSC will have the opportunity to set specific requirements for projects funded through the RWSC Offshore Wind & Wildlife Research Fund. Requirements should include explicit budgeting for data management (at least 10% of total project costs (Tanhua et al., 2019; Trice et al., 2021)), designation of a data manager who will be responsible for development of a data management and sharing plan, and seeing that data are appropriately documented and shared. The DGSC should lead the development of these requirements, including creating a data management and sharing plan template, starting with a review of existing programs to identify guidance and best practices.\nConsistent, complete metadata is the foundation of the offshore wind & wildlife data ecosystem and the ability to create an RWSC data catalog. Standardized metadata is part of the global best practice of making data FAIR — Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable — within the RWSC community and beyond (Tanhua et al., 2019; Wilkinson et al., 2016). FAIR principles are consistent with the RWSC’s core values of Transparency and Accessibility and not only support the Science Plan, but also support future re-use by new partners for questions not yet imagined (Hoeberling, 2022). In addition to the FAIR principles, the CARE principles for Indigenous data stewardship provide guidance for working with Indigenous knowledge and other information from communities while respecting data sovereignty and local control (Carroll et al., 2020). The RWSC should strive to achieve FAIR principles for all data and incorporate CARE principles as appropriate.\nMetadata standards and data standards are often prescribed by repositories. However, the DGSC will need to look across the recommended repositories to formulate a ‘minimum information standard’ that will ensure inclusion of useful information in the RWSC data catalog. This should not be a wholly new standard but a clear subset of components drawn from existing metadata standards recommended by the Subcommittees. For the data catalog, the RWSC may develop guidance and tools that explain and streamline metadata creation for new or undocumented data or utilize software that programmatically gleans existing metadata from data that are already published or archived in repositories.\nDGSC roles:\n\nReview the metadata and data standards for the repositories recommended by the Subcommittees.\nDevelop the minimum metadata set for the data catalog and facilitate review by Subcommittees.\nDevelop a data management and sharing plan template for RWSC-funded projects.\nCreate a basic data sharing policy that can be incorporated by reference in any contract.\n\nSubcommittee roles:\n\nEncourage and support RWSC participants to use the data repositories recommended by the Subcommittees.\nDevelop or encourage and support RWSC participants to use standard data collection templates/data sheets for each taxon or data type.\nInform the development of the DGSC data sharing and management template and adapt it to meet Subcommittee needs, data types, and data products.\n\n\n\n\n3 - Creating a Data Catalog\nData catalogs are detailed collections of metadata that make up a searchable inventory of datasets and products. The RWSC data catalog would connect the components of the offshore wind and wildlife data ecosystem and enable the discovery and sharing of data funded by the RWSC and partners in support of the Science Plan. With a robust data catalog, RWSC would function as a coordinator and information hub without having to store data or serve as a data repository. The Offshore Wind & Wildlife Research Database contains information at the project level, but a data catalog would operate at the dataset or data product level. It would pull descriptive metadata describing each dataset from the external repositories in the offshore wind and wildlife data ecosystem so that anyone could find and access it.\nThe minimum metadata set in Recommendation #2 will be needed for the catalog to operate, and the wind “identifier” described in Recommendation #1 could also assist in pulling in data from external repositories.\nDGSC roles:\n\nDevelop technical requirements for the catalog.\nReview and evaluate potential catalog hosts and technical infrastructure.\nRecommend options to the Steering Committee.\n\nSubcommittee roles:\n\nRecommend catalog hosting options.\n\n\n\n4 - Building network capacity to steward unique or orphaned data\nWhile this may not be a major focus for the DGSC, there are data types, such as large image files from aerial high-definition cameras or thermal cameras, that do not have an existing repository. For the RWSC and partners to be able to preserve this data for future use, the DGSC will need to investigate options for hosting the data. This could involve working with partners who manage or maintain existing data infrastructure to develop a solution. Having the RWSC procure and maintain its own hosting solution should be a last resort, due to the limited capacity of the organization.\nDGSC roles:\n\nAs requested, explore solutions for orphan data.\n\nSubcommittee roles:\n\nIdentify orphan datasets that need alternate hosting solutions.\nRecommend data standards and best practices for data documentation.\n\n\n\n5 - Providing general data governance support and education\nRWSC data partners and participants have a wide range of expertise and disciplinary backgrounds. This makes it important to develop shared language around data governance, data management, and participant expectations. The DGSC should explore creating a data handbook and glossary of key terms that helps anyone engage with the data ecosystem, whether they are agency managers, data scientists, biologists, or attorneys. The DGSC could also write up case studies and examples showing how data governance works from different partner perspectives and for different data types and workflows, helping make the concept of data governance more tangible. This type of community education will help develop consistency and shared understanding across the RWSC’s efforts and build the overall data capacity of the offshore wind and wildlife community.\n\n\n\n\nAbraham, R., Schneider, J., Brocke, J. vom, 2019.

    "text": "3.2 Data Collection\nSeveral entities are requiring, funding, and/or advocating for marine mammal research and data collection activities with respect to offshore wind. Ongoing and planned activities, including marine mammal monitoring that is being required by agencies, are captured in the Offshore Wind & Wildlife Research Database.\nIndividuals and entities should consult with the Marine Mammal Subcommittee prior to collecting marine mammal data with respect to offshore wind to ensure that any new data collection does not duplicate existing efforts and is consistent with the tools and approaches already in use. Any individual or entity may join public Marine Mammal Subcommittee meetings by obtaining meeting links on the RWSC website.\nA combination of methods (visual, acoustic, tagging) is recommended to provide the most complete information and context to marine mammal observations, given the strengths and limitations of each method alone (see the Marine Mammal Appendix for more information):\n\n(Cross taxa) Leveraging BOEM’s and NOAA’s ongoing efforts, ensure that the required Protected Species Observer data collected by offshore wind companies during construction and operations via Pile Driving Monitoring Plans and Vessel Strike Avoidance Plans (and any other mitigation plans) follows a consistent reporting approach and is eventually submitted to a Master Protected Species Observer Sightings Database for use in marine mammal analyses and research.\nEnsure that other marine mammal and environmental data collection required by the agencies during installation (e.g., sound fields, visual monitoring, PAM, thermal/infrared camera systems) are collected using consistent methods such that data can be used in other analyses and research including broader scale analyses of potential impacts across many projects.\n(Cross-taxa) Continue regional scale protected species and habitat data collection activities through the Atlantic Marine Assessment Program for Protected Species (AMAPPS), Ecosystem Monitoring Survey; NOAA Fisheries North Atlantic Right Whale Aerial Surveys, NOAA Fisheries Marine Mammal and Sea Turtle Aerial Surveys, NOAA Fisheries Marine Mammal, Sea Turtle, and Seabird ship-based surveys; NOAA Fisheries Seal aerial abundance surveys. Advance the NOAA Fisheries and BOEM Survey Mitigation Strategy (Hare et al., 2022) to ensure that site-specific and regional scale studies are put in the context of population trends and ecosystem conditions.\n(Cross-taxa) Coordinate regular high-definition aerial surveys that cover multiple lease areas using the same tools and methods. This effort should leverage the considerable amount of high-definition aerial photography data collected during site assessment by multiple offshore wind developers, and the Southern New England megafauna aerial surveys that have occurred consistently since 2011.\nContinue to support the adaptive design and implementation of a regional long-term archival passive acoustic monitoring network in the Atlantic Ocean and guide future research including:\n\nCharacterize baseline ambient sound and sound/noise during all phases of development, leveraging the regional passive acoustic monitoring network.\nExpand passive acoustic monitoring outside of wind energy areas, especially along the shelf break, including using gliders and real-time systems.\nTo the extent practicable, ensure alignment between archival and real-time deployments. Ensure that whale detections from real-time systems can be folded into analyses and data products that also leverage archival detections.\nIncorporate collection of oceanographic data and prey fields into the regional-scale PAM network.\nImprove estimates of acoustic detection rates and cue rates of baleen whales during non-construction conditions.\nImprove dose-response curves by obtaining in-situ behavioral data at offshore wind construction sites on baleen whale responses to pile driving noise. This would require collecting a range of data types including PAM and visual observations (aerial or ship-based).\nCouple aerial/visual monitoring with acoustic monitoring to address the issues above and better link the resulting observational datasets.\nCo-deploy acoustic telemetry receivers to build out a telemetry receiver network, and other sensors as practicable.\n\nCollect marine mammal behavioral and health data through tagging and visual observations to determine how individuals interact with wind farm structures and whether changes to foraging, socializing, or reproduction are occurring.\nIn collaboration with NOAA Fisheries, continue and expand stranding data collection and analysis with respect to strandings and mortality data time series analysis for the U.S. Atlantic Ocean.\nMonitor entanglement with subsea structure of floating offshore wind structures and monitor secondary entanglement where derelict fishing gear/marine debris may attach to subsurface offshore wind structures.\nAdvance oceanographic and biological data collection and use in marine mammal research.\n\nCoordinate with the North East Regional Association of Coastal and Ocean Observing Systems (NERACOOS), Mid-Atlantic Regional Association of Coastal Ocean Observing Systems (MARACOOS), and Southeastern Coastal Ocean Observing Regional Association (SECOORA).\nLeverage existing ocean observing platforms or add new ocean observing assets for marine mammal monitoring.\nWork with the Habitat & Ecosystem Subcommittee to ensure that key oceanographic and habitat data are collected and available as data products for use in marine mammal studies and as model covariates.\nWork with the Habitat & Ecosystem Subcommittee to determine whether offshore wind structures alter hydrodynamics, stratification, and mixing, and/or prey distribution and abundance.\nContinue to collect data across the region that allows analysis and synthesis of prey fields. Develop a coordinated regional scale zooplankton monitoring and mapping effort that builds off of and links existing surveys and studies including programs monitoring dimethyl sulfide, EcoMon, Continuous Plankton Recorder, the Gulf of Maine MBON, BOEM-funded Zooplankton Ecology study, Canadian AZMP, Center for Coastal Studies, Northeast U.S. Shelf LTER, and projects conducted by Stony Brook University and Rutgers University to establish a broader ecosystem observing system, synthesize patterns, and identify trends and linkages across trophic levels.\n\n\nThere is a need to advance technologies that improve marine mammal detection during all phases of offshore wind development, and to ensure that the performance of new technologies is evaluated consistently (see the Technology Chapter):\n\nDevelop, evaluate performance, and apply existing and emerging technologies that enhance marine mammal detection, including thermal cameras, infrared cameras, passive acoustics systems, and systems that integrate multiple methods for use during construction and operational monitoring and mitigation. Test “smart” mitigation methods triggered by marine mammal presence as determined by these systems.\nAdvance quieting technologies meant to mitigate construction noise (piledriving, vessel traffic) and operational noise (vessel traffic, operational vibratory sound).\nDevelop and deploy safe long-duration satellite tagging telemetry technology for tracking high-resolution movements of marine mammals in and around offshore wind structures.\nImprove analysis of monitoring data through artificial intelligence, automated acoustic, and image processing, and near real-time data availability.\n(Cross taxa) Develop and test eDNA assays/surveys/sampling regimes to understand efficacy of use developing indices of occurrence/abundance, including testing the effect of carcasses in the environment on eDNA detection.\n\nThe Gulf of Maine has long represented important feeding grounds for baleen whales from late fall to early spring (NOAA CetSound, 2015). A resident population of Harbor porpoise is present in the coastal/nearshore areas of the Gulf of Maine from July to September (NOAA CetSound, 2015). Almost all of the Gulf of Maine subregion is critical habitat (Northeastern U.S. foraging area) for North Atlantic right whales. Given that offshore wind development areas are still being identified in this subregion, baseline data collection should seek to characterize fine scale spatial and temporal habitat use. Studies of impacts specific to floating offshore wind (e.g., secondary entanglement), including modeling, should be coordinated through the Subcommittee. Cape Cod Bay, as a historical whale aggregation location, could serve as a sentinel site or control site to monitor potential population-level impacts to whales.\nIn Southern New England, known whale foraging hotspots (e.g., Nantucket Shoals) should be monitored using multiple methods to understand potential changes in behavior and habitat use. Studies of hydrodynamics and physical oceanography at the turbine- and wind farm-scales should seek to disentangle climate change drivers from offshore wind development and understand any changes that may impact whale prey (ACP, 2023; NASEM, 2023).\nWhale and dolphin sightings in the New York/New Jersey Bight have increased recently and includes increases in juvenile humpback whales in coastal waters, likely due to an increase in their menhaden prey. These whales may be particularly vulnerable to vessel strike due to their behavior and high density and speed of vessels in nearshore waters of this region (Stepanuk et al., 2021). Studies of whale-prey relationships and potential displacement from offshore wind areas in this region should be tailored to this context and capture rapidly changing ecosystem conditions and existing human uses in this area.\nThe U.S. Central Atlantic includes small resident populations of bottlenose dolphins, and large whales occur here and in the U.S. Southeast Atlantic at relatively lower densities than the other subregions. Data collection strategies and studies should be designed with the lower expected densities in mind. Both regions are important migratory routes, and the U.S. Southeast Atlantic contains critical habitat for North Atlantic right whale calving. More information is needed about the ways that reproductively active female right whales respond (or do not respond) to physical structures, noise, and vessels in their environment before wind projects are implemented in the Southeast right whale calving habitat. Characterizations of marine mammal distribution, abundance, and movement should continue in these subregions using multiple methods as offshore wind planning and development advances."

The Subcommittee is especially interested in studies that seek to distinguish between climate change-driven shifts in marine mammal distribution, abundance, and behavior and changes that may be driven by offshore wind construction and operation. Related changes of interest include:\n\nWhether construction activities displace or attract marine mammals\nWhether offshore wind structures displace or attract marine mammals\nWhether marine mammal feeding is altered due to changes to hydrodynamics or prey distribution/abundances caused by offshore wind structures\n\nIndividuals and entities should consult with the Marine Mammal Subcommittee prior to conducting analyses of marine mammal data with respect to offshore wind to ensure that the study leverages all of the available data and contributes to addressing the key recommendations described below to the extent possible:\n\nLeverage extensive existing and long-term data sources. These include but are not limited to AMAPPS, NOAA Fisheries North Atlantic Right Whale Aerial Surveys, Southern New England Aerial Megafauna Surveys, long-term/archival PAM, as well as shorter-duration observational studies (aerial, boat-based, tagging) as foundational elements of any analysis.\nConduct a synthetic baseline assessment of marine mammals over the past several decades to characterize pre-development levels of spatial and temporal variability in marine mammal distribution and abundance patterns, from which to measure and assess any potential changes after the onset of offshore wind construction and regional-scale operation activities. Integrate density modeling and/or visual survey data, passive acoustic monitoring data, tagging data, oceanography/habitat data, and climate data to characterize pre-development levels of spatial and temporal variability in marine mammal distribution and abundance patterns.\nContinue to update and improve marine mammal density models. Use outputs to understand drivers of marine mammal distribution and movement and to assess/detect change, displacement, and/or potential impacts. Periodically evaluate model performance and use validation and evaluation results to continually inform and advance model/framework development and applications.\n\nIntegrate the latest observational and environmental data every 2-3 years.\nIntegrate data from multiple additional methods (strandings, digital aerial surveys, passive acoustic data, tagging) and covariates (oceanographic and prey distribution). Apply results to inform research designs, determine baseline abundance/distribution estimates, best practices, etc.\nConsider how to structure future model “eras” to reflect offshore wind pre-construction and construction/operation.\nThe modeling framework should be scalable to individual projects and the whole region such that individual project-specific outputs could be pooled into regional-scale versions of the model.\n\nRepeat a power analysis to optimize the design of the long-term archival passive acoustic monitoring network every 3-5 years. Ensure that new monitoring assets and analysis results are accounted for and that existing or new hypotheses and questions can be addressed by the regional network.\nInform and evaluate the effectiveness of mitigation strategies meant to minimize impacts resulting from increases in vessel traffic (i.e., noise, collision, displacement) from construction and maintenance of offshore wind projects.\n\nDevelop or update existing vessel and marine mammal co-occurrence models with information from the offshore wind industry regarding vessel types and numbers. Validate models with AIS and effort-corrected whale sightings data.\nConduct studies to assess the effectiveness of mitigation strategies such as speed restrictions, establishment of traffic corridors, etc.\n\nModel and assess entanglement risks associated with floating offshore wind.\nBuild off Project WOW and apply lessons learned to studies in and around other lease areas outside Southern New England and New York/New Jersey Bight. Use Project WOW Frameworks to identify stressors, species, and geographic areas to conduct assessments of displacement, attraction, or other changes to wildlife abundance, distribution, behavior, and/or health.\nIntegrate multiple types of data (e.g., acoustic, visual, stable isotopes, bycatch estimates, vessel trip reports) to understand potential changes in marine mammal feeding behaviors.\nDetermine whether prey distribution, abundance and/or behavior is altered due to hydrodynamic changes caused by offshore wind structures and from EMF/cables (heat and electromagnetic field).\nScope studies of EMF and marine mammals.

    "text": "4.2 Data Collection\nIn coastal and marine environments, a wide variety of field research methods can inform scientific understanding of avian interactions with offshore wind facilities (for common methods and recent advances, see (Courbis et al., 2023; NREL and PNNL, 2022; ORJIP, 2022). As part of Construction and Operations Plans (COPs), offshore wind developers are developing and submitting avian monitoring plans. Current available draft monitoring plans typically include deploying Motus and/or satellite tags on birds of conservation concern for a specified number of years post-construction, deploying and maintaining Motus receiver stations for a specified number of years, deploying passive acoustic or multi-sensor detectors on turbines or other offshore wind facility infrastructure, and conducting boat-based or aerial surveys. State agencies, federal agencies, and conservation and research organizations regularly deploy tags, deploy and maintain Motus stations, and conduct surveys of nesting birds within the RWSC Study Region. Standardized boat-based and aerial surveys are also conducted with state and federal funding.\nAs part of addressing near and long-term goals, and in the context of ongoing work, the Bird & Bat Subcommittee recommends the following field research, data interpretation, and technology advancement activities:\n\nUsing appropriate methods to further characterize movements, distributions, and abundance of wide-ranging bird species offshore, before and after construction.\n\nThe Bird & Bat Subcommittee will convene regularly to coordinate tagging/tracking efforts for species of interest in the context of offshore wind along the U.S. Atlantic Coast. Activities will include identifying general focal locations and focal species for tag deployment, exploring the potential to centralize tag deployment efforts, and coordinating deployment, calibration, and maintenance of Motus receiver network infrastructure.\nCoordinating and conducting regular digital aerial surveys that cover multiple lease areas and appropriate buffer zones using a standardized methodology. As wind energy areas are leased and developed, aerial surveys covering individual lease areas plus appropriate buffers (see draft guidance) can be expected to survey portions of adjacent lease areas, so coordination could provide cost-efficiencies, as well as supporting standardized data products.\nDeploying passive acoustics and multi-modal systems at offshore wind facilities and on other offshore infrastructure to monitor for nocturnal migrants.\n\nContinuing standardized breeding bird surveys along coastlines and on islands to understand population dynamics, assess species distributions, and inform population models (see Data Analysis).\nExpanding seabird diet and foraging studies to inform understanding of offshore wind facility effects. Conducting laboratory analyses of previously stored samples, as needed.\nDeploying multi-modal systems on turbines to assess bird interactions with wind turbine infrastructure (including micro-avoidance and collision risk). Combinations of acoustic detectors, radar systems, impact detection sensors, and/or visual, thermal, and infrared cameras are recommended to document bird behavior around wind turbines, detect impacts, and, to the extent possible, provide species-specific identification.\nIn addition to the methods detailed above, deployment of radar or lidar systems to document bird passage rates and flight heights is also recommended.\nDeveloping, testing, and advancing new, emerging, or under-utilized technologies for monitoring and mitigation.\n\nTesting and validating bird collision detection systems (recognizing that initial validation may need to focus on land-based wind facilities, where carcass counts are possible).\nTesting and validating the efficacy of on-site mitigation strategies (e.g., lighting, painted blades), including evaluation in both land-based and offshore environments.\nTesting and validating the efficacy of off-site mitigation strategies or voluntary conservation offsets. (This is expected to take place only after the planning for and identification of appropriate options as described under Data Analysis.)\nImproving remote access to wildlife monitoring equipment on wind turbine platforms or other offshore infrastructure. This could include identifying workflows to allow for the transmission of wildlife monitoring data using existing wind facility fiber-optic networks.\nScoping and designing standardized spaces on offshore wind infrastructure to support wildlife monitoring equipment, including physical access, electrical power, data transfer capabilities, etc. This will require cross-sector and cross-taxa coordination.\nDesigning and improving automated methods to efficiently derive data from raw data files, such as deriving species identification and counts from digital aerial photographs, species identification within acoustic recordings, or tracking movement paths on radar and video recordings.\nDeveloping and improving tagging technologies to allow for lighter tags, longer-term tracking, measurement of additional parameters, or more precise measurement (e.g., of flight height)."

As part of Construction and Operations Plans (COPs), offshore wind developers are developing and submitting avian and bat monitoring plans. Of relevance to bats, current available draft monitoring plans typically include deploying passive acoustic detectors on turbines or other offshore wind facility infrastructure, deploying active acoustic detectors on work vessels accessing the facility, and deploying and maintaining Motus receiver stations for a specified number of years post-construction. State agencies, federal agencies, and research organizations regularly deploy acoustic detectors in coastal environments. Motus or standard VHF tags have also been deployed on bats utilizing habitat in coastal areas (Dowling, 2018; Peterson et al., 2021; True et al., 2023).\nAs part of addressing near and long-term goals, the Bird & Bat Subcommittee recommends the following field research, data interpretation, and technology advancement activities:\n\nData collection to characterize bat activity and collision risk in the rotor-swept zone of offshore wind turbines.\n\nUsing passive acoustic detectors mounted on turbine platforms, towers, and nacelles to document bat activity year-round.\nDeploying multi-modal systems on turbines to assess bat interactions with wind turbine infrastructure (including micro-avoidance and collision risk). Combinations of acoustic detectors, radar systems, impact detection sensors, and/or visual, thermal, and infrared cameras are recommended to document bat behavior around wind turbines, detect impacts, and, in some cases, provide species-specific identification.\nRecording contemporaneous turbine operational status and local meteorological data to inform patterns of bat activity, behavior, and collision risk relative to turbine operation and environmental conditions.\n\nUse of acoustics to better understand onshore-to-offshore gradients of bat activity pre- and post-construction. Leveraging existing platforms (e.g., vessels which already make regular trips through offshore waters, offshore buoys, other offshore infrastructure) and coastal and island sites will aid in this effort.\nUse of Motus tagging/tracking systems to characterize patterns of bat movement offshore (Acoustic studies alone may fail to fully capture bat activity if bats regularly refrain from  echolocation while flying over the ocean (Corcoran et al., 2021; Corcoran and Weller, 2018).\n\nDeploying Motus tags on migratory tree bats (hoary bats, eastern red bats, silver-haired bats) to evaluate patterns of movement during the spring and late summer-fall migration seasons.\nDeploying Motus tags on Perimyotis and Myotis species of conservation concern in coastal areas and on islands in late summer to evaluate dispersal from maternity colonies to swarming or overwintering sites.\nCoordinating deployment of Motus stations to streamline calibration and optimize placement (see Chapter 4).\n\nDevelopment, testing, and advancement of new, emerging, or under-utilized technologies for monitoring and mitigation.\n\nTesting and validating bat collision detection systems (recognizing that initial validation may need to focus on land-based wind facilities, where carcass counts are possible).\nImproving access to remote wildlife monitoring data and integrating wildlife monitoring equipment on wind turbine platforms or other offshore infrastructure. This could include identifying workflows to allow for the transmission of wildlife monitoring data using existing wind facility fiber-optic networks.\nDesigning and improving auto-classification of acoustic data to identify species or taxa.\nImproving tagging technologies and attachment methods to allow for lighter tags and longer-term tracking.\nIf mitigation is deemed necessary, testing and validating the efficacy of on-site mitigation strategies (e.g., feathering, curtailment, deterrents). As noted above, validation of mitigation in the offshore environment will be difficult, and the development of effective bat collision detection systems, validated at land-based wind facilities, would be necessary for validation of mitigation measures in the offshore environment. Alternatively, efficacy would need to be estimated based on land-based proxies and the best available science."

    "text": "6.2 Data Collection\nIndividuals and entities are encouraged to attend Sea Turtle Subcommittee meetings while planning new sea turtle-offshore wind research and data collection to leverage the available resources and guidance compiled by the Subcommittee. The Subcommittee is comprised of sea turtle experts from federal agencies, states, research institutions, and other private entities. Any individual or entity may join public Sea Turtle Subcommittee meetings by obtaining meeting links on the RWSC website.\nThere is little fine-scale baseline data on abundance and density of sea turtles in the U.S. Atlantic. The primary methodology for determining sea turtle abundance and density—manned aerial surveys—is not designed to detect small individuals which make up a large proportion of the Kemp’s ridley and green sea turtle populations. Of those two species, the Kemp’s ridley is critically endangered. Parameters for baseline data collection on behavior, physiology, and distribution have not been established. Without established baselines effective for all species and size classes, assessing and mitigating effects of offshore wind on sea turtles will be extremely difficult.\nFew ongoing offshore wind studies include sea turtles as the target species group. The Offshore Wind & Wildlife Research Database captures targeted studies of sea turtles and offshore wind, offshore wind studies where sea turtle data may be recorded in an ancillary fashion, existing and often long-term sea turtle monitoring programs that were not specifically designed to measure potential offshore wind impacts. Where sea turtles will be studied as an ancillary research target, it is unclear how or whether sea turtle data will be analyzed.\nThe Subcommittee recommends the following regional-scale data collection efforts for sea turtles (recommendations appropriate for other taxa are labeled as cross taxa):\n\nUse expert input to develop standardized data collection methods to quantify impacts of offshore wind on sea turtles in the context of limited baseline data and climate change effects.\n(Cross taxa) Leveraging BOEM’s ongoing efforts, ensure that the required Protected Species Observer data collected by offshore wind companies during construction and operations via Pile Driving Monitoring Plans and Vessel Strike Avoidance Plans (and any other mitigation plans) follows a consistent reporting approach, is eventually submitted to a designated repository, and available to offshore wind community for use in sea turtle research, mitigation, and management.\nIncrease level of regional-scale sea turtle species data collection for a variety of baseline parameters through new and existing federal partnerships (e.g., BOEM’s Environmental Studies Program, AMAPPS, U.S. Navy projects, NMFS projects).\n(Cross taxa) Align new data collection activities with the objectives in the NOAA Fisheries and BOEM Federal Survey Mitigation Strategy (Hare et al., 2022). Review the strategy where it directly addresses sea turtle survey needs and support the development of a Northeast Survey Mitigation Program and similar efforts for the Southeast Region.\n(Cross taxa) Once protocols for consistent phase-gradient experimental designs assessing sea turtle parameters are developed, prioritize data collection at individual project areas during construction, operation, and demolition to determine if activities displace or attract sea turtles.\n(Cross-taxa) Coordinate regular high-definition aerial surveys that cover multiple lease areas using comparable tools and methods. This effort should leverage the considerable amount of high-definition aerial photography data collected during site assessment by multiple offshore wind developers.\nEmploy NOAA Fisheries recommendations to enhance AMAPPS loggerhead turtle abundance estimates (NOAA Fisheries, 2020) and expand detection studies to all sea turtle species and sizes under a variety of conditions.\nCollect surface time and dive data on all species in all subregions and appropriate seasons to inform 3D distribution and dive behavior baselines as well as surface time estimates (for availability estimates which will also inform sea turtle surface density models).\nCollaborate with additional partners to facilitate data and information sharing, including the Sea Turtle Stranding and Salvage Network, organizations conducting sea turtle nest monitoring, sea turtle rescue organizations operating under USFWS permits and authorization as well as satellite, acoustic and other tag data.\n\nTechnology needed to improve sea turtle detection and access:\n\nDevelop and test smaller tags with depth sensors capable of surface time calculations for availability bias calculations in smaller turtles.\nDevelop and test (non-archival) tags and/or tag attachment techniques with low drag for capture/release in difficult (offshore) environments.\nDevelop and test remote tag attachment techniques for in-water work.\nContinue development, testing, and deployment of safe, long term external attachment and/or internal insertion methods (Innis et al., 2023) for acoustic tags on sea turtles in order to efficiently make use of this resource.\n(Cross taxa) Develop and test eDNA assays/surveys/sampling regimes to understand efficacy of use developing indices of occurrence/abundance, including testing the effect of carcasses in the environment on eDNA detection.\n\nEach subregion has differences in both sea turtle occurrence and the scale and timeline of offshore wind development. Subregion specific recommendations are:\nIn the Gulf of Maine, where floating offshore wind development is planned, but where development areas are still being identified, baseline data collection is needed. Small, focused studies on individual animal movement and behavior that are site specific may be most effective strategies for assessing impacts. Data collection in this subregion should include efforts to characterize and monitor gelatinous prey (i.e., jellyfish and ctenophores) as it is unclear how/whether floating turbines will affect this important sea turtle prey group.\nIn Southern New England and the New York/New Jersey Bight, approved offshore wind projects pose the first opportunity to study sea turtle behavior during construction and operation and to identify potential impacts to sea turtles. It is unclear whether baseline abundance/density data for loggerhead and leatherback turtles in this subregion will be sufficient to detect changes or attribute causes of detected changes in abundance/density using distance sampling techniques. Thus, data collection should focus within and distant from the project envelopes in this subregion and should also include vessel corridors. Turbine construction activities are designed to avoid times when critically endangered North Atlantic right whales were historically in the area (January-April), but these limitations may not avoid the times of highest sea turtle occurrence.\nExcept for the Maryland Offshore Wind project, it appears that there is little voluntary sea turtle research or monitoring associated with the other offshore wind projects in the U.S. Central Atlantic. This subregion, however, is likely to have 1) higher turtle densities of most species, 2) longer seasonal sea turtle occurrence and 3) active breeding and nesting adults compared with projects to the north. In addition, restrictions on turbine construction activities designed to avoid critically endangered right whales will mean that construction will occur when densities for most sea turtle species in subregion are highest. Impact studies and data collection in the US Central Atlantic subregion should be focused in and adjacent to lease areas and nearby vessel corridors.\nAll four sea turtle species have a year-round presence in the U.S. Southeast Atlantic which provides foraging, nesting, and breeding habitat for all species. However, there are currently no ongoing or planned research projects related to offshore wind and sea turtles in the RWSC Database in this subregion."

Design for the studies below should be tailored to detect and understand potential effects on sea turtles specifically, with other wildlife data to be collected ancillary to the target species.\nInform where new data collection is needed:\n\nUse expert input to assess experimental design and develop data analysis methods and parameters to quantify impacts of offshore wind on sea turtles in the context of multiple data streams, limited baseline data, and climate change effects.\nDetermine/describe useful baseline parameters for sea turtle distribution and behavior to be used where abundance/density data are not available.\nDevelop robust vertical water column use understanding for all sea turtle species, in all subregions and seasons to assist in the development of baseline behavior and abundance estimates for sea turtle species.\nAnalyze datasets collected for other focal species for sea turtle species presence (e.g., high-definition aerial imagery, eDNA).\nDetermine the efficacy of acoustic telemetry for sea turtles, especially if internal tag placement is accepted as a methodology in sea turtles (Innis et al., 2023).\n\nIdentify concerns/hindrances of acoustic telemetry deployment on turtles (permitting, attachment options, turtle access, etc.).\nWork with other user groups to understand and improve receiver deployment (designs) and share data.\n\n\nCharacterize oceanographic and habitat drivers of sea turtle distribution, abundance, and behavior:\n\nUpdate and refine the U.S. Navy and/or develop NOAA Fisheries sea turtle abundance/density estimates and surface density models.\n\nIntegrate the latest observational and environmental data every 2-3 years.\nIntegrate data from multiple additional methods (strandings, digital aerial surveys, tagging, fishery and dredge take data) and covariates (oceanographic and prey distribution).

Analysis should focus on seasonal migratory timing, (seasonal) offshore distribution, dive behavior in a variety of seasons/subregions/depths, environmental variables correlated with animal movement. Develop standardized data products for sea turtles from movement data that can be replicated across sites and scales. Apply results to inform research designs, determine baseline parameters, best practices, etc.\n\nDetermine whether offshore wind is impacting sea turtles negatively or positively:\n\nAssess whether conducting a quantifiable cumulative stressor assessment (Love et al., 2017) will provide insight into the scale of potential impacts of offshore wind on sea turtles.\nAssess the power of aerial survey data to detect changes in turtle abundance/density in the vicinity of offshore development.\n\nDescribe current limitations of visual aerial and digital surveys (e.g., depth of detection by size, sea state and other environmental parameters; small animal (&gt;40cm carapace length)) and identify existing or develop new turtle-specific and multispecies best practices and needed technology to improve detection.\n(Cross taxa) Work with other taxa groups to develop plans on how to consistently conduct aerial surveys near turbines in a manner comparable to previous survey data.\n\n(Cross taxa) Develop protocols for consistent phase-gradient experimental designs assessing sea turtle density, distribution, and behavior to be applied at individual project areas during construction and operation to determine if activities displace or attract sea turtles, such that data and results can be pooled into larger regional scale studies.\nDevelop an understanding of sea turtle hearing and reaction to offshore wind noises by species and life stage including behavioral and physiological impact of noise created by offshore wind construction and operation.\n(Cross taxa) Develop or update existing vessel and sea turtle/marine mammal co-occurrence models with vessels of various type and size associated with turbine construction and operation with the ultimate goal of modeling/estimating mortality attributable to vessel strikes associated with offshore wind.\n(Cross taxa) Some effects of offshore wind development on sea turtles, both individually and at population levels, are likely to be indirect, cumulative, synergetic, and difficult assign to a single cause.

    "section": "7.2 Data collection",
    "text": "7.2 Data collection\nThere is a lack of baseline data on most protected fish species and all their life stages in areas where offshore wind projects will or may occur. The lack of baseline data is compounded by the varied and unknown impacts to these species from climatic change. An urgent priority is to improve understanding of distribution and movement for most life stages in wind energy areas so that it is possible to properly assess, monitor, and mitigate any impacts. The Subcommittee recommends using multi-modal approaches (telemetry, eDNA, trawl surveys, aerial surveys) to fill data gaps, though acoustic and satellite telemetry appear to be the quickest and most effective means to enhance understanding. The Subcommittee stresses the importance of relying on local experts as the ecosystems differ greatly throughout the region, as does protected fish use of each wind energy area. Each individual project becomes even more valuable when data can be compared and integrated at broader scales.\nSeveral entities are requiring, funding, and/or advocating for protected fish species research and data collection activities with respect to offshore wind. All ongoing and planned activities, including protected fish species monitoring that is required by agencies, are captured in the Offshore Wind & Wildlife Research Database. To scope future studies, the Subcommittee is guided by earlier research on protected fish species and their interactions with wind energy areas in both Europe and the United States. The descriptions of potential effects to protected fish such as underwater noise, vessel collision, entanglement, introduction of new structures, and electromagnetic fields are summarized in the Environmental Effects of U.S. Offshore Wind Energy Development: Compilation of Educational Research Briefs (SEER, 2022) and the Synthesis of the Science (Hogan et al., 2023). The gaps and needs are captured in the Atlantic Offshore Wind Environmental Research Recommendations(Regional Synthesis Workgroup of the Environmental Technical Working Group, n.d.) as well as (Hogan et al., 2023).\nMost offshore-wind-specific monitoring to-date of protected fish species in the U.S. Atlantic is occurring in Southern New England and the New York/New Jersey Bight on Atlantic sturgeon (Frisk et al., 2019; Haulsee et al., 2020; Ingram et al., 2019; Rothermel et al., 2020), with the goal of characterizing baseline distribution and movement. In the Gulf of Maine, protected fish species monitoring at the University of Maine’s Vulturn US 1:8 floating turbine indicated no change in the detection frequency of tagged Atlantic salmon, Atlantic Sturgeon, or shortnose sturgeon on receivers near the turbine following energization (Brady, 2015). There are also significant and ongoing data collection efforts in estuaries and coastal areas throughout the RWSC study area. While most of these efforts are not explicitly related to offshore wind, their findings can be used to augment the baseline understanding of protected fish species in the region.\nRelevant long-term protected species, fisheries, and ecosystem surveys conducted by the NOAA Fisheries Northeast Fisheries Science Center include:\n\nAutumn bottom trawl survey\nSpring bottom trawl survey\nGulf of Maine Cooperative Bottom Longline Survey\nEcosystem Monitoring Survey (6 times per year)\nCoastal Shark Bottom Longline Survey\nCooperative Atlantic States Shark Pupping and Nursery Longline/Gillnet Survey\n\nIndividuals and entities should consult with the Protected Fish Species Subcommittee prior to collecting protected fish species data with respect to offshore wind to ensure that any new data collection does not duplicate existing efforts and is consistent with the tools and approaches already in use. Any individual or entity may join public Protected Fish Species Subcommittee meetings by obtaining meeting links on the RWSC website, where all past meeting materials are also available.\nThe Subcommittee recommends the following data collection activities:\n\nDeploy fine-scale acoustic receiver arrays in and around every leased and proposed Wind Energy Area and along associated cable routes. Pair deployments with acoustic and satellite tagging of protected fish.\n\nPlan and implement telemetry data collection activities in a consistent way, such that data and metadata from individual projects is standardized and interoperable.\nExpand projects like Buoys of Opportunity across the region to co-locate acoustic receivers to structures already in/going in the water.\nCouple on-bottom deployment of acoustic receivers with bottom temperature measurements to the extent possible.\nEncourage all new tags/groups to submit data to the Animal Telemetry Network and/or appropriate regional nodes in an agreed upon time frame to allow for archiving, securing, and publishing. \n\nDesign a distributed region wide system of receiver arrays that serve as the backbone for projects throughout the region. This includes receivers offshore/along the shelf, which are limited in the current project landscape.\n\nEnsure that this system has sustained investment for operation and maintenance.\nEncourage all new tags/groups to submit data to the Animal Telemetry Network and/or appropriate regional nodes in an agreed upon time frame to allow for archiving, securing, and publishing.\n\nPair additional methods with telemetry data collection, including conventional tagging (i.e., non-electronic), eDNA, and aerial surveys to aid the identification of changes in residency or usage of the area.\nEvaluate the risks of known impact producing factors to protected fish from offshore wind development.\n\nDevelop tools and monitoring mechanisms to better understand if/when vessel strikes occur and what vessels are typically involved.\n\nCoordinate with state agencies for recorded information on protected fish sightings, incidental catches, and beach strandings, particularly Atlantic and shortnose sturgeon.\nEnsure sufficient human and financial resources to support local salvage operations.\nCreate and test mitigation measures to prevent vessel strikes.\n\nConduct further laboratory and field studies of EMF effects on protected fish species, especially Chondrichthyes and sturgeons, to assess potential impacts including changes in migration patterns, feeding, or behavior. Conduct similar studies on protected fish prey species.\nConduct in situ examinations of noise impacts to protected fish species.\nAssess primary and secondary entanglement risk to all protected fish species given the potential for increased recreational fishing near wind turbines and increased possibility of secondary entanglement. \n\nAlign data collection and research activities with the recommendations in the NOAA Fisheries & BOEM Federal Survey Mitigation Strategy (Hare et al., 2022).\nCollaborate with other Subcommittees to maximize data collection efforts.\n\nMarine Mammal: maintain a shareable database and/or map of the acoustic telemetry receivers that may be co-located with bottom-mounted passive acoustic hydrophones.\nTechnology: Test and implement any technological advancements that may be required to continue long-standing scientific surveys and data collection in areas that are no longer accessible or are accessible in a limited extent that will influence continuity of surveys.\nSea Turtle: Ensure that sea turtle researchers can access telemetry receiver data if desired.\nHabitat and Ecosystem: Work to ensure that key oceanographic and habitat data are collected and available to use in coordination with studies on protected fish. \n\n\nTechnology advancements to improve protected fish research and monitoring:\n\nDevelop and test telemetry tags with further miniaturization for use with smaller individuals.\nImprove data resolution and positional accuracy of telemetry tags and test adding sensors (magnetometers, sound, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll, etc.) to existing tags.\nInvestigate the use of eDNA to measure species abundance in addition to occurrence.\nImprove or develop machine learning and/or Artificial Intelligence detection for soniferous protected fish in passive acoustic data.\n\nIn the Gulf of Maine, where offshore wind projects are still in the planning phases, baseline data about the occurrence, distribution, and movement of protected fish species is needed. Floating offshore structures include cables and mooring lines that span the entire water column, including some that emit EMFs. Potential effects from EMF and secondary entanglement should be monitored. Focal species in these regions include Atlantic salmon, Atlantic sturgeon and shortnose sturgeon. The oceanic whitetip shark and giant manta ray may also be found in this region.\nIn Southern New England and New York/New Jersey Bight, existing baseline data collection from multiple tools such as acoustic telemetry, satellite telemetry, eDNA, and trawl surveys, need to be better integrated to characterize protected fish species’ distribution and movement pre-offshore wind construction. These data should also continue to be collected throughout all phases of development to characterize changes from pre-construction baselines. Focal species in these regions include Atlantic sturgeon and shortnose sturgeon. The oceanic whitetip shark and giant manta ray are also found in this region.\nIn the U.S. Central Atlantic and U.S. Southeast Atlantic, baseline data collection on the occurrence, distribution, and movement of protected fish is most urgent in the U.S. Central Atlantic where projects are farther along in the development process. The U.S. Central Atlantic is home to the Atlantic sturgeon, shortnose sturgeon, giant manta ray, and whitespotted eagle ray. These species are also present in the U.S. Southeast Atlantic, in addition to the listed Central & Southwest Atlantic distinct population segments of scalloped hammerhead shark, Nassau grouper, and smalltooth sawfish."

The list also specifies whether the variable was identified by RWSC Subcommittees as a potentially useful covariate for species distribution modeling (Hogan et al., 2023; MDAT, 2017; Roberts et al., 2016).\nEnsure that oceanographic/meteorological data collected during offshore wind and wildlife surveys/studies is compiled and made available for use in other analyses and research.\n\nCollect meteorological, hydrographic, oceanographic, and productivity data in a consistent way from the fine- to regional scales to informs models (see Data Analysis) and produce a collection of standardized data products for priority species modeling covariates:\n\nSee the list of key variables, parameters, and platforms/methods in the Appendix.\nEnsure that hydrodynamic and oceanographic processes are consistently measured across the RWSC study area.\nProcesses of interest for which data should be collected for modeling (training and validation) include:\n\nMid-Atlantic cold pool formation; stratification in general\nLocal turbulence production and induced mixing of different offshore wind foundation structures\nWater quality and light penetration (e.g., chemical contamination associated with increased vessel traffic and presence of offshore wind structures, effects on suspended particulate matter and turbidity)\nAtmospheric effects associated with energy removal by wind turbines (e.g., wake effects, the effects on waves, currents, and other air-sea interactions)\nWind farm-induced flow and atmospheric response to both momentum and heat fluxes\nAmbient soundscapes and sound propagation data\nPhytoplankton composition/biomass/abundance, primary productivity, and change over time; occurrence and persistence of harmful algal blooms\nZooplankton composition/biomass/abundance, secondary productivity, and change over time\nFood availability for filter feeders and links to higher trophic levels\n\nWhere appropriate, using observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs) to determine optimal location of oceanographic observing at the region-wide scale.\n\nCoordinate with the IOOS RAs and RWSC Subcommittees that may be deploying instrumentation via buoys to strategically co-locate sensors for oceanographic, meteorological, and habitat data.\nInvesting in region wide data collection with AUVs and remote sensing, including gliders, to supplement buoy data and collect more seamless broad scale coverage of physical oceanographic and biogeochemical data, and to record ambient noise.\n\nIdentify reliable reference/control sites, which may also be areas of high ecosystem productivity, for long-term monitoring and baseline data collection of multiple oceanographic variables in areas outside of wind lease areas.\n\nAdvance technologies that facilitate widespread oceanographic and meteorological data collection, transmission, and data management during all phases of offshore wind development, and to ensure that the performance of new technologies is evaluated consistently (see Technology chapter recommendations).\n\nDevelop, test, and validate novel platforms for collecting oceanographic and meteorological data\nLeverage existing and improve real-time data transmission technologies from offshore platforms (cost, availability, reliability)\n\n\nThe Gulf of Maine is warming faster than 99% of the world’s oceans (Pershing et al., 2015). Oceanographic effects of floating turbines may differ from those of bottom-mounted turbines because of differences in structures spanning the whole water column (mooring lines vs. foundations). In this subregion there are gaps in understanding of the potential impacts on physical and biological resources from hydrodynamic and atmospheric alterations due to turbine presence (Blair et al., 2022). There are currently relatively few federal ocean observing buoys collecting data in the Gulf of Maine planning area, especially in the deepest basins where offshore wind development is most likely. Oceanographic observations in the planning area should be increased to characterize baselines, disentangle climate signals, and measure potential effects from offshore wind development.\nConstruction- and post-construction wildlife monitoring in Southern New England, New York/New Jersey Bight, and U.S. Central Atlantic should include oceanographic data collection. The Mid-Atlantic Cold Pool will likely be a focus of data collection and studies given its dynamic nature and influence on food webs in these subregions. However, there are few federal ocean observing assets in the deeper waters of the RWSC study area. Additional platforms will be coming online in the MA/RI Wind Energy Area associated with the Wind Forecast Improvement Project 3 in late 2023 and early 2024, and there is the opportunity to co-locate sensors with the expansion of the Passive Acoustic Monitoring Network (see the Marine Mammal chapter. Given the area covered by multiple contiguous leases in these locations, it will be important to collect data consistently such that cumulative impacts from multiple wind farms on oceanography and habitat can be studied. Studies to characterize hydrodynamics of Nantucket Shoals and other important megafauna foraging habitats (e.g., coastal New Jersey) should monitor potential impacts from climate change-driven shifts in oceanography and physical forcing, as well as human activities to separate any impacts from those associated with offshore wind development.\nResearch efforts in the U.S. Southeast Atlantic should focus on areas that are the likely targets of wind development (i.e., the northern third to one-half of the subregion). Upwelling is an important process in this subregion where seasonal stratification and Ekman transport push deep Gulf Stream waters onshore. These nutrient-rich deep waters drive productivity in the U.S. Southeast Atlantic, but overall, relationships between seasonal oceanographic forcing and biological responses in this subregion are poorly documented and understood. Data collection and modeling should focus on the potential effects from wakes on cross-shelf transport and resulting impacts to the ecology of the subregion."

    "section": "9.2 Data Collection",
    "text": "9.2 Data Collection\nSeafloor data collection is funded and implemented by multiple entities that participate in RWSC. Ongoing and planned activities are captured in the Offshore Wind & Wildlife Research Database.  For offshore wind companies, geophysical site characterization activities (i.e., seafloor mapping and data collection) inform multiple aspects of project development including engineering and risk assessment. Overall, the precise types of field data collection, processing, and analysis activities conducted by offshore wind companies are not well-known or consistent with respect to spatial coverage, applied methods, and sampled parameters. Geophysical site assessment information is often redacted in Construction and Operations Plans (COPs) posted to BOEM’s website. From a review of publicly available COPs, seafloor acoustic, imagery, and grab methods are often not applied consistently, and the footprints of investigations vary from within the wind lease area and along proposed export cable paths to land, only areas with proposed wind turbine generator locations, and, in some cases, areas beyond the lease area’s boundaries. This Subcommittee will lead the collaborative development of recommendations for improving the standardization of site assessment seafloor data collection and dissemination across offshore wind projects.\nAside from data collected by commercial entities, the Subcommittee will coordinate with and leverage existing and ongoing efforts by multiple groups to identify geographic data gaps in high-resolution seafloor mapping data (U.S. Interagency Working Group on Ocean and Coastal Mapping; National Ocean Mapping, Exploration, and Characterization Council (NOMEC); Northeast Regional Ocean Council Habitat Classification and Ocean Mapping Subcommittee). These groups produce regular updates to data gaps assessments and publish map products that help guide new data collection. A current map showing survey coverage of digital soundings data (i.e., seafloor acoustic data) is available via the NCEI Bathymetric Data Viewer. In consideration of this information and evolving prioritizations, the Subcommittee recommends general areas where new seafloor data collection is needed:\n\nOutside the boundaries of offshore wind leases throughout the RWSC study area.\nContinental shelf waters further from shore, including central and eastern Gulf of Maine and offshore Southern New England waters.\nWaters off the shelf near the BOEM Central Atlantic Planning areas.\n\nThe Subcommittee also recommends the following activities:\n\nDevelop recommended practices for consistent post-construction benthic monitoring to ensure regional compatibility of site-specific data:\n\nStatistical frameworks to guide sampling design, including the spatial and temporal extents over which effects can be detected.\nFrequency of sampling, including adaptive sampling after storms or other acute disturbances (e.g., nearby construction activity).\nConsistent methods to identify appropriate reference locations and to define “recovery from disturbance.”\nBenthic community variables, ecological functions, and processes of interest (e.g., spawning, larval habitat, recruitment, feeding, growth).\n\nMonitor the transport, occurrence, and prevalence of non-native and invasive species on/via offshore wind infrastructure.\nCharacterize biological colonization (i.e., sessile, attached, and epiphytic flora and fauna) of new structures, the marine communities they attract and support, and any associated biogeochemical changes to the surrounding environment (e.g., nutrient enrichment, carbon burial).\nPeriodically re-evaluate and standardize data collection and field methods to ensure collected data are suitable for regional needs.\nAdvance, evaluate, and apply new technologies and techniques to support seafloor data collection and habitat mapping analyses:\n\nAutonomous seafloor mapping platforms.\nNon-extractive sampling techniques (e.g., imagery, video, eDNA).\nArtificial intelligence for image classification (e.g., NOAA NCCOS Enhancing Habitat Mapping Accuracy and Efficiency Using Artificial Intelligence).\n\n\nIn the Gulf of Maine, there is almost no modern high-resolution seafloor data overlapping with the newly released draft Wind Energy Area. A few groups are working to address this (NOAA Deep Sea Coral Research and Technology Program, Northeast Regional Ocean Council Habitat Classification and Ocean Mapping Subcommittee), but additional geophysical and seafloor sampling data should be collected to establish baseline seafloor habitat characterizations.\nOf the active offshore wind leases in Southern New England and the New York/New Jersey Bight, several publicly available COPs provide information about seafloor data collection. Collaborative work with respect to developing data sharing workflows and recommendations for standardization should leverage this available information as a case study. Lessons learned from the data collection and monitoring of the Block Island Wind Farm should be applied here. With construction ongoing in these subregions, studies should seek to characterize the effects of construction activities on seafloor environments and benthic communities, the colonization of new structures, and how far any effects are felt from these activities (spatially and temporally).\nLessons learned from the seafloor data collection and monitoring of the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind Pilot project should be applied to studies in the U.S. Central Atlantic. Data collection outside the active leases in the area is needed, as most active projects are currently focused in lease areas.\nThere are limited field data collection activities occurring in the U.S. Southeast Atlantic and no publicly available COPs for offshore wind projects."

    "text": "10.1 Introduction\nThe RWSC Steering Committee identified the need for a Technology Subcommittee to provide a forum for wildlife and marine science experts to discuss potential applications, key questions, and challenges related to the use of technology in wildlife/environment monitoring with members of the tech-startup, marine technology, and ocean engineering communities.\nThis Subcommittee, first convened in April 2023, is building off and includes membership from existing groups and efforts to test and advance technology with respect to offshore wind and wildlife/environment monitoring:\n\nMarine Technology Society: The Marine Technology Society promotes awareness, understanding, and the advancement and application of marine technology. Incorporated in 1963, the international society brings together businesses, institutions, professionals, academics, and students who are ocean engineers, technologists, policy makers, and educators. The Society publishes a peer-reviewed journal — The Marine Technology Society Journal. It has 31 Professional Committees (technical interest groups), including the newly-formed Offshore Renewable Energy Committee. The Committee promotes the use of marine technology innovation and research in the rapidly growing offshore renewable energy community. To do this the Committee will provide a forum for communication and networking events that facilitate the exchange of information, including discussion of relevant marine technology applications, training and education opportunities.\nNational Offshore Wind Research & Development Consortium (NOWRDC): a nationally focused, not-for-profit organization collaborating with industry on prioritized R&D activities to reduce the levelized cost of energy of offshore wind in the U.S. while maximizing other economic and social benefits. The Consortium is focused on, but not limited to, technology advancement in each of three initial research pillars: Offshore Wind Farm Technology Advancement; Offshore Wind Power Resource and Physical Site Characterization; and Installation, Operations and Maintenance, and Supply Chain.\nTechnology needs for scientifically robust wildlife monitoring and adaptive management: A project conducted by Advisian and the Biodiversity Research Institute, funded by NOWRDC. This project, which culminates in August 2023, will make targeted recommendations for technology development around priority questions with respect to marine mammals and birds in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Great Lakes for fixed and floating offshore wind projects.\nWind Energy Monitoring and Mitigation Technologies Tool: A free, online tool to catalog monitoring and mitigating technologies developed to assess and reduce potential wildlife impacts resulting from land-based and offshore wind energy development. Initiated by the International Energy Agency Wind Task 34 – Working Together to Resolve Environmental Effects of Wind Energy (WREN) the tool provides the research status of technologies to ensure the international community has access to current, publicly available information on monitoring and mitigation solutions, their state of development, and related research on their effectiveness. Reviewed on a biannual basis.\nOffshore Wind Innovation Hub: The New York-based Offshore Wind Innovation Hub was launched by Equinor, together with its partner bp. The hub will facilitate partnerships with start-ups that bring new technological solutions to the rapidly growing U.S. offshore wind industry. The initiative will begin as a three-year partnership between Equinor, the Urban Future Lab at the New York University Tandon School of Engineering, and NOWRDC, supported by New York City Economic Development Corporation.\nGreentown Labs Go Energize 2023: Greentown Labs, the largest climate tech incubator in North America, and Vineyard Wind, developer of the first utility-scale offshore wind farm in the United States, are collaborating on Greentown Go Energize 2023, a program supported by the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center, aimed at startups that are innovating solutions for offshore turbine monitoring and ecological data collection, as well as digital solutions to improve turbine efficiency and longevity.\n\nTechnology Subcommittee members representing these existing initiatives and others from states, federal agencies, eNGOs, offshore wind companies, consulting companies, and the research community emphasized the need to continue employing both traditional methods with new technologies for both validation purposes and to provide additional context or data that new technologies cannot provide. The Subcommittee identified the following high-level themes for their future work. The purpose of this chapter is to further frame these themes and identify near-term actions to advance them.\n\nTechnology advancements provide the potential to accelerate multiple phases of offshore wind development by improving our ability to anticipate, detect, and mitigate potential impacts to wildlife and the ecosystem.\nThere are three categories of interest to the Subcommittee where new technologies need to be tested and applied: monitoring, mitigation, and data management. Many projects are already being funded to test and/or advance new technologies for the purposes of offshore wind and wildlife/environment within these categories, and the Subcommittee should continue to track the implementation and results of such projects.\nThere is a need to develop criteria to evaluate the effectiveness of new technology with respect to “traditional methods” or other new technologies."

Technologies that would address this goal include:\n\nPredictive modeling to anticipate potential wildlife occurrence in wind energy areas.\nSystems that improve wildlife detection rates in both space and time, allowing for more rapid mitigation responses.\nTools and systems that deter wildlife or mitigate potential stressors such as noise, electromagnetic fields, entanglement from abandoned, lost, or otherwise discarded fishing gear, and physical disturbance.\n\nOther applications of technology that are of interest to the Subcommittee include the advancement of long-term monitoring methods and streamlining research data collection. Given the scale of proposed offshore wind development, experts noted that consistent data collection across the RWSC study area will be more attainable with the adoption of new technologies. Already, tools like gliders and un-crewed systems (air and water) are covering more ground offshore than would be possible with traditional ship-based sampling or fixed-bottom sensors.\nAccelerating sustainable and responsible offshore wind development will require critical technology enhancements. However, the Technology Subcommittee acknowledges that as investments in new technologies continue, there is a need for new approaches to be objectively tested for their efficacy and value over or in addition to traditional methods. The Subcommittee expressed a goal to advance a multi-sector discussion and development of criteria for technology evaluation. The second theme of this chapter describes ongoing and planned projects that are advancing and testing new monitoring, mitigation, and data management technologies. Following that inventory, the Subcommittee presents high-level categories under which specific metrics for technology performance evaluation could be developed under theme three."

    "section": "10.3 Ongoing and planned activities within the three categories of technology applications",
    "text": "10.3 Ongoing and planned activities within the three categories of technology applications\nThe Technology Subcommittee identified three categories of new technology where testing and evaluation may be needed: monitoring, mitigation, and data management. Many projects are already being funded to test and/or advance new technologies with respect to offshore wind and wildlife/environment within these categories. This section summarizes those efforts. The Marine Mammal, Sea Turtle, Bird, Bat, Oceanography, Seafloor, and Protected Fish Species chapters of this Plan describe the applications of accepted technologies and methods for monitoring, mitigation, and data management (e.g., real-time passive acoustic sensors paired with whale detection algorithms) and recommendations for future technology development and applications pertinent to the study of wildlife and the environment. This Technology chapter focuses on tools and methods that are still undergoing evaluation for usefulness and efficacy.\nThe Technology Subcommittee will continue to lead discussions with the other Subcommittees with respect to advancing new technologies. RWSC will provide the forum for conversations that require input from wildlife biologists and ecologists and technology experts and providers.\nThe Subcommittee is aware that some entities may not wish to share their ongoing or planned work on technology advancement for commercial purposes. Therefore, the content in this section is assumed to be incomplete.\n\n10.3.1 Monitoring\nMonitoring activities include the required and voluntary data collection activities that seek to characterize wildlife presence, distribution, abundance, behavior, movement, and health, as well as benthic and pelagic habitat features that could be affected by offshore wind development or drive changes in species presence, distribution, abundance, behavior, movement, and health.\nTable 10.

For example, integrating passive acoustic monitoring, radar systems, and unmanned aerial vehicles could enable an above-and-below water 3D real-time monitoring capability, which could lead to faster adaptive management. Artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques offer the potential to enhance species detection and identification, potentially improving the speed of mitigation applications. The cost-effectiveness of mitigation measures needs to be carefully evaluated to ensure their feasibility broad scales.\nTable 11.

Environmental Data Analysis: R and Python (along with other statistical packages).\nSoftware Tools for the Mitigation of Wind Turbine HF Radar Interference in the U.S. IOOS Network\n\n\n\n\n\n10.3.3 Data Management Technologies\nThe effective collection, storage, and security of data play a crucial role in wildlife monitoring and mitigation efforts in offshore wind environments.\nThe Data Governance and Data Management chapter of the Science Plan describes the existing and needed processes and components of effective and collaborative offshore wind environmental data management but does not propose specific technological solutions. The Data Governance Subcommittee can work together with the Technology Subcommittee to ensure that RWSC is recommending and pursuing appropriate and effective technological solutions for data management. This section briefly describes the different components of environmental data management where technology advancements could improve existing workflows.\n\n10.3.3.1 Local Data Storage\n\nWhere real-time transmission is not required or feasible, data storage devices such as data loggers, memory cards, or hard drives collect and store data from sensors and monitoring devices (e.g., buoys, animal tags and receivers). These devices are then physically transported back to onshore facilities for data retrieval and analysis.\nHigh-capacity storage devices and long-lasting batteries enable longer deployments.\n\n\n\n10.3.3.2 Data transfer/transmission\n\nSubsea Cables: Cabled monitoring devices tethered to onshore data centers or monitoring stations provide reliable and high-bandwidth data transfer. Offshore wind projects include numerous subsea cables (interarray and to shore) to transmit power and in some cases, data.\nAcoustic modems and optical modems can transfer data from the collection device to another storage device for transportation to shore, eliminating the need to remove the device from wherever it is mounted (underwater or atop a turbine, for example).\nWireless Networks: The LoRaWAN® specification enables wireless connectivity for battery-operated devices in regional or global networks, supporting IoT requirements. The LoRaWAN® specification is a Low Power Wide Area (LPWA) networking protocol designed to wirelessly connect battery-operated to the Internet in regional, national, or global networks. It targets critical Internet of Things (IoT) requirements such as bi-directional communication, end-to-end security, mobility, and localization services. In some cases, offshore wind installations may utilize subsea cables that connect monitoring devices to onshore data centers or monitoring stations. These cables provide a reliable and high-bandwidth connection for continuous data transfer.\nSatellite modems (e.g., iridium) transmit data to shore via satellite. Frequency of transmissions is limited by cost.\nRemote sensing techniques, such as HF Radar and satellite imagery rely on satellite communication networks to transmit collected data.\n\n\n\n10.3.3.3 Secure Data Transfer, Access Control, and Backup\n\nSecure Data Transfer: Encrypted connections and secure file transfer protocols ensure data confidentiality and integrity during transmission. Secure data transfer protocols are used to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of data during transmission between offshore platforms and onshore facilities. Encrypted connections and secure file transfer protocols (e.g., SFTP, FTPS) are commonly employed to protect data during transit.\nAccess Control and User Permissions: User authentication, role-based access control, and data segregation strategies manage user permissions and data security. Access control mechanisms are implemented to manage user permissions and control who can access, modify, or retrieve specific datasets. User authentication, role-based access control (RBAC), and data segregation strategies are employed to ensure data security and privacy.\nData Backup and Disaster Recovery: Regular backup procedures and disaster recovery plan to safeguard against data loss and ensure data resilience.\nRegular data backup procedures are essential to prevent data loss due to technical failures, system malfunctions, or unforeseen events. Offshore wind data management systems often include backup strategies and disaster recovery plans to ensure data resilience and continuity.\n\n\n\n10.3.3.4 Secure Platforms for QA/QC and Review\n\nQA/QC Processes: Standard operating procedures, automated data validation algorithms, and manual review ensure the quality and accuracy of collected data.\nQuality Assurance of Real-Time Oceanographic Data (QARTOD): QA/QC processes are implemented to validate and ensure the quality and accuracy of collected data. This includes establishing standard operating procedures (SOPs) for data collection, entry, and validation. QA/QC checks can involve automated data validation algorithms, manual data review, and cross-validation with reference data sources.   IOOS supports the QARTOD program.\nData Validation Tools: Software applications or scripts automate checks to identify errors or inconsistencies in the data. Data validation tools are software applications or scripts that perform automated checks on the collected data to identify potential errors, inconsistencies, or outliers. These tools can help ensure data quality and flag any anomalies that require further investigation or correction.\nData Review and Auditing: Independent experts or internal review teams systematically examine collected data for accuracy, completeness, and compliance with standards. Data review and auditing involve systematically analyzing the collected data to verify its accuracy, completeness, and compliance with defined standards. This process may involve independent experts or internal review teams assessing the data against specific criteria or industry guidelines.  RWSC Subcommittees could play a role in data review and auditing, leveraging the data management best practices described in each Science Plan chapter.\n\n\n\n10.3.3.5 Data Catalogs and Repositories\nData catalogs, which are hubs for connecting data stored in several distinct locations, are discussed in the Data Governance & Data Management chapter. The technological requirements, capacity, and examples of active data catalogs will be discussed by the Data Governance Subcommittee.\nRepositories store and provide access to data (and may also provide cataloging functions). Existing wildlife and environmental data repositories recommended by each Subcommittee are presented in the previous chapters of the Science Plan. Each Subcommittee also made recommendations for augmenting existing or developing new repositories for emerging data types that don’t currently have a widely used or accepted repository. Several technical features have emerged as important for repositories that may be used to store wildlife and environment offshore wind data:\n\nWeb-based and platform-independent\nCredentialed access to certain components\nLarge volume and efficient data upload/input and download/egress\n\n\n\n10.3.3.6 Other\n\nData Management Tools: Cloud-native data management architecture and tools enhance data management and accessibility. Reaching for the Cloud is a collaboration between IOOS and RPS Group Ocean Science. This project aims to identify the technological and process shifts needed to develop a cloud-native architecture that will serve the current and future needs of the IOOS community.\nCollaborative Projects: Projects such as Reaching for the Cloud and “SoundCoop” focus on developing cloud-native architectures and promoting improved accessibility and applications for data management. Sound Coop, or Passive Acoustic Monitoring National Cyberinfrastructure Center, is a project that is Piloting a community-focused, national cyberinfrastructure capability for passive acoustic monitoring data, technology, and best practices to promote improved, scalable, and sustainable accessibility and applications for management and science.  The RWSC is on the Sound Coop Steering Committee and will be able to both inform and leverage the resulting work."

    "text": "10.4 Potential criteria for evaluating the performance of new technologies for monitoring and mitigation\nAs new technologies and innovations develop on multiple fronts related to offshore wind and wildlife (monitoring, mitigation, data management), the Technology Subcommittee recognizes the need to consistently evaluate any new tools and approaches against traditional methods and alternative technologies.\nTechnology Subcommittee members recommend developing a mutually agreed-upon set of criteria that decision makers, funders, and users of technology can apply and interpret to evaluate the performance of the technology, potential appropriate uses of the technology, and any potential risks associated with applying the new technology.\nA set of evaluation criteria would ensure that new methods and tools are evaluated consistently, fairly, and more efficiently than if custom performance evaluations are conducted each time a new technology emerges. The criteria should be evaluated every few years to ensure that they continue to be relevant and responsive to the needs of decision makers, funders, and users.\nThere are several existing technology evaluation frameworks that the Subcommittee may refer to as it advances its work on this topic:\n\nTechnology Readiness Assessment Guide, U.S. Department of Energy, DOE G 413.3-4A\nGuidance notes on qualifying new technologies, American Bureau of Shipping\nTechnology Assessment Design Handbook, U.S. Government Accountability Office\n\nBelow, the Subcommittee presents draft categories of evaluation criteria for new technologies with respect to offshore wind and wildlife/environment. The Subcommittee recommends convening smaller multi-sector expert work groups to guide and participate in the evaluation of specific tools as the needs arise.\nThe Technology Subcommittee’s latest work and planned events related to Technology Workshops can be found at https://rwsc.org/technology-workshops.\nRWSC is receiving support from several partners across sectors for providing capacity for workshops to advance these recommendations:\n\nRWSC will ensure consistency with Science Plan objectives/recommendations and that RWSC partners have the opportunity to participate.\nThe Marine Technology Society (MTS) will engage their Offshore Renewable Energy Committee and other MTS community members.\nDOE’s National Laboratories (NREL and PNNL), under the leadership of the RWSC and their Technology Subcommittee and in consultation with NOAA, BOEM, and DOE, will convene a group of experts and relevant stakeholders to discuss available whale detection technologies.\nOpportunity to leverage NOWRDC-funded technology gap/readiness analysis by Advisian/BRI – forthcoming report.\nUse next NYSERDA State of the Science Workshop (July 2024) as opportunity to hold workshop sessions and/or technology showcases.\nNOAA & BOEM leadership, ACP, and eNGOs supportive and commit to participate.\n\n\n10.4.1 Potential categories of technology evaluation criteria\n\nAccuracy and Precision\nAdvanced technologies could provide higher accuracy and precision in detecting, identifying, and tracking wildlife species than traditional methods. Technology also allows more consistent and reliable data collection and monitoring, leading to more high-quality data. Potential metrics include false/true positive/negative rates and distance efficacy.\n\n\nEfficiency and Scalability\nTechnology advancements enable more efficient data collection, processing, and storage, allowing for the collection and handling of large volumes of data. This scalability is essential given the extent of proposed offshore wind development in U.S. Atlantic waters.\n\nCost Efficiency\nAs technology advances, costs associated with monitoring, mitigation, and data management can be reduced. This allows for more cost-effective implementation of monitoring programs, making it feasible to adopt advanced technologies and sustain long-term monitoring efforts. A potential metric in this category is cost savings over time.\n\n\nFaster Data Analysis and Interpretation\nTechnology advancements like machine learning and artificial intelligence enhance data analysis and interpretation capabilities. These technologies automate data processing, enabling extracting meaningful insights, identifying patterns, and detecting potential risks or impacts.\n\n\n\nSafety\nNew technologies may provide safer mechanisms for data collection than traditional or manual methods, especially in potentially dangerous conditions offshore. Technology advancements could result in increased deployment and data collection success if humans aren’t required to wait for safe conditions or work in suboptimal conditions.\n\n\nReal-Time Capabilities\nAdvanced technologies offer real-time monitoring capabilities, enabling prompt notification of wildlife presence, behavior changes, or other characteristics. Real-time data can be used to trigger mitigation measures and/or adaptive management promptly, which may result in an overall reduced risk of wildlife interactions and minimized disturbances to sensitive species.\n\n\nMitigation Effectiveness\nTechnology advancements contribute to developing innovative mitigation measures by developing deterrent systems or shutdown protocols that effectively reduce collision risks and minimize wildlife disturbance.\n\n\nSupply Chain\nNew technologies may not be implemented unless the materials and labor force exists for producing components or the entire technology solution.\n\n\nData Integration and Collaboration\nAdvanced technologies promote data integration from multiple sources and platforms, enabling a holistic view of the offshore wind/wildlife/environment system. This integration facilitates collaboration among researchers, wind farm operators, regulators, and conservation organizations, fostering knowledge sharing and effective conservation strategies.\n\n\nData Management and Security\nTechnology advancements enhance data management and security, ensuring the integrity, accessibility, and privacy of collected data. Robust data storage infrastructure, encryption protocols, and access control mechanisms safeguard sensitive information while facilitating data sharing and compliance with data protection regulations.\n\n\nPublic Awareness and Engagement\nTechnology advancements in data visualization and communication tools enable effective dissemination of monitoring results and engage the public in wildlife and ecosystem monitoring. Accessible and engaging communication can raise awareness about the importance of offshore wind/wildlife/environment monitoring and keep the public informed of ongoing data collection and research."

During Science Plan development, Subcommittee meeting agendas included opportunities for participants to provide input on the content of each chapter. All Subcommittee meetings were open to the public, and recordings and meeting summaries are posted publicly.\nThe RWSC developed the Offshore Wind & Wildlife Research Database to capture the ongoing and planned research that participants were sharing during Subcommittee meetings. The Database provided a way for each entity’s research and data collection efforts to be included in the Science Plan by reference. The Subcommittees then used the Database to develop recommendations for data collection and research that should be continued or initiated to fill existing knowledge gaps. Funders and researchers can continue to share information about their work by submitting project information to the Database via an online form.\nFrom June 30 – September 30, 2023, a complete draft of the Science Plan, reflecting the Subcommittees’ recommendations, was made available on the RWSC website for public comment. All interested individuals were invited to provide feedback by filling out an online comment form, uploading a comment letter, and/or uploading edits and annotations to the draft itself. During the Science Plan comment period, each of the four RWSC Caucuses met to discuss the draft Science Plan and share feedback with each other and RWSC staff."

    "title": "11  Science Plan Review & Revision Process",
    "section": "11.4 Frequently asked questions",
    "text": "11.4 Frequently asked questions\nWhy wasn’t [group] included in the development of the Science Plan?\nThe four sectors (federal agencies, states, eNGOs, and offshore wind companies) invited participation in Science Plan development from any individual or entity via public Subcommittee meetings and the 90-day public comment period. All are welcome to join RWSC Subcommittee discussions and to provide input on research recommendations.\nWhy is [dataset] not mentioned in the Science Plan?\nIt is the Subcommittees’ recommendation that all available data are evaluated for usefulness in new analyses and research. The Science Plan and the Offshore Wind & Wildlife Research Database describe an incredible number of datasets and data collection efforts. Even so, the Subcommittees recognize that these compilations are likely incomplete, both because new efforts are being added continuously, and because there are so many potentially relevant ocean data collection efforts.\nOne challenge encountered by all Subcommittees was to appropriately distinguish between data collection and research activities specifically funded and designed to study offshore wind and wildlife/environment interactions, versus those activities that were not designed to study the potential effects of offshore wind but might still provide useful data in such studies. The Database has been revised to reflect this distinction to the extent practicable, recognizing that some categorizations might not be clear in all cases.\nA consistent recommendation across all Subcommittees is for prospective funders and researchers planning new data collection activities related to offshore wind and wildlife to join a few Subcommittee meetings to ask about existing data and share ideas. These discussions could highlight new or additional datasets not yet described or included in RWSC materials and ensure their inclusion in new work.\nWhy aren’t there any recommendations for fisheries research included in the Science Plan?\nThe scope of the RWSC Science Plan does not include fisheries or commercially managed fish species. For research needs and considerations on those topics, visit the Responsible Offshore Science Alliance (ROSA; https://www.rosascience.org). While both RWSC and ROSA are engaging in regional coordination and advancement of research and monitoring related to interactions between offshore wind and ecosystems, ROSA’s focus is fisheries (commercial and recreational) and RWSC’s focus is wildlife. Each organization exists because issues related to the intersection of offshore wind and fisheries often differ from those of wildlife and endangered species. To ensure close coordination on issues in the RWSC Science Plan that might relate with ROSA’s work, ROSA staff participate in the RWSC Protected Fish Species and Habitat & Ecosystem Subcommittees. In addition, RWSC and ROSA Directors and staff meet monthly to share progress and build on opportunities to align work.\nWho are “RWSC participants” or “RWSC partners”?\nThese phrases are RWSC’s way of being as inclusive as possible in all of its work. Anyone who would like to participate in offshore wind and wildlife science discussions or work more closely with RWSC is invited to do so via public Subcommittee meetings, or by contacting RWSC staff directly.\nHow far offshore is the RWSC study area?\nThe entities that collaboratively lead RWSC have jurisdiction within the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). However, RWSC recognizes that species and ecosystems are not limited by political boundaries. To accommodate this fact, the ecological focus of the Science Plan includes all habitats occupied by the species under study. This could require collaboration with entities outside of the U.S. at times.\nHow is RWSC going to implement the Science Plan?\nThe new Executive Summary of the Science Plan lays out actions that the four sectors will take to implement the Science Plan. It is likely that Science Plan recommendations will be funded by a combination of individual entities that collaborate via RWSC and by funding provided to RWSC specifically for Science Plan implementation. Funds provided to RWSC may be pooled from several individual sources. For funds provided to RWSC, funding decisions will reside with the Steering Committee, informed by the expert Subcommittees, considering any limitations on the use of funds, and funders’ priorities.\nWhen will the Science Plan be updated?\nThe RWSC Steering Committee will evaluate the Science Plan in five years (i.e., at the end of 2028) to determine whether it needs to be updated. At that time, the Steering Committee will likely request input from each Subcommittee and RWSC participants on whether updates to each chapter and/or the whole Plan are needed. The Steering Committee will then develop a work plan to accomplish any needed updates that specifies a process and timeline over which updates will be completed."

    "text": "D.2 Focal Marine mammal species and recent trends in the RWSC study area \nMarine mammals include baleen whales and toothed whales (together, cetaceans), seals (pinnipeds), and manatees (sirenians). Distributions of marine mammals have been shifting in response to changes in their environment, including human activities, climate change, and conservation measures. For a current list of marine mammal species and their status in the RWSC study area, visit the NOAA Fisheries Species Directory at https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/species-directory/ and apply filters for “New England/Mid-Atlantic” and “Southeast”. \nAll marine mammal species are protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) which prohibits intentional or incidental killing, injuring, or harassment of marine mammals and specifies the circumstances and rules under which permits may be issued for such activities. Under the MMPA, NOAA Fisheries has developed stock assessment reports for all marine mammals in U.S. waters since 1994. These reports contain estimates of current species population sizes and population trends. Six marine mammal species are also listed as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), which prohibits “take” of these species and requires conservation of their habitat. In addition to stock assessment reports, NOAA Fisheries generates authoritative and up-to-date information on marine mammal status and trends via the following webpages: \n\nMarine Mammal Unusual Mortality Event\nNOAA Fisheries Protected Species Surveys\nMarine Mammal Health and Stranding Response Program \n\nEnvironmental Impact Statements (EISs) associated with the U.S. National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review of offshore wind projects provide detailed descriptions of the affected environment, impact analysis, and cumulative effects. Each proposed offshore wind project’s Final EIS should be considered an important reference for focal marine mammal species, recent trends, habitat considerations, and potential impacts. Final EISs are posted to BOEM’s website. \nFrom a regional and global perspective, natural and anthropogenic climate change are recognized as major drivers of changes in marine mammal distribution, and in some cases, abundance as well (Chavez-Rosales et al., 2022; Ganley et al., 2022; Meyer-Gutbrod et al., 2022; Pendelton et al., 2022; Thorne et al., 2022). Baleen whales’ prey in particular– which include zooplankton and small fish species–are susceptible to ocean warming and changes in ocean circulation. In response to climate-driven shifts in their prey, baleen whales have shifted foraging locations into places where fewer protections are available (Davies and Brillant, 2019), or where conflicts with more human uses are likely. NOAA’s 2023 State of the Ecosystem New England report (Lucey et al., 2023) describes the slow movement of several marine mammal species to the northeast and into generally deeper water (Chavez-Rosales et al., 2022) (and see figure below). \n\nFigure 1.  Direction and magnitude of core habitat shifts, represented by the length of the line of the seasonal weighted centroid for species with more than 70 km difference between 2010 and 2017 (tip of arrow) (Chavez-Rosales et al., 2022).\nThe following data products and tools provide relevant context to inform where new data collection is needed and which research questions are most urgent to address given present status and trends in marine mammal distribution, abundance, behavior as observed in the field or understood by the most recent analyses. These sources are updated frequently.

The dataset was compiled by the NOAA NEFSC Passive Acoustic Research Program using detection data collected by many collaborators.\nWhaleMap: Designed to communicate the latest whale survey results to scientific, regulatory, and industrial sectors to inform more effective, dynamic planning of research and conservation activities. The map is synchronized with data repositories from several different survey groups such that results are reported in near-real time.\nWhale Alert app: Launched in 2012 as a citizen science tool aimed at reducing the risk of vessel strikes. The free app uses whale presence data including verified sightings, acoustic detection from buoys and gliders, and aerial surveys to display a user-friendly map based on nautical charts from country-specific government agencies.\nRight Whale Seasonal Management Areas & Dynamic Management Areas (Slow Zones): Seasonal Management Areas (SMAs) for North Atlantic right whales are zones and times of year when all vessels 65 feet or longer must travel at 10 knots or less to reduce the threat of vessel collisions1. Dynamic Management Areas (DMAs) are triggered when groups of whales are sighted outside of active SMAs. NOAA Fisheries has proposed several modifications to North Atlantic right whale vessel speed regulations which will likely take effect in 2024. Please check NOAA’s website for updated information: https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/endangered-species-conservation/reducing-vessel-strikes-north-atlantic-right-whales#current-vessel-speed-restrictions.

For the most recent requirements, see the outreach guide for each location and gear type on the ALWTRP webpage. The complete plan is published in the Code of Federal Regulations (§ 229.32 Atlantic large whale take reduction plan regulations).\nBiologically Important Areas (BIAs) for Cetaceans within U.S. Waters: BIAs represent areas and times in which cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises) are known to concentrate for activities related to reproduction, feeding, and migration, as well as the known ranges of small and resident populations (NOAA CetSound, 2015). Updated descriptions and maps for U.S. East Coast BIAs are not yet available (as of October 2023) but will be incorporated by reference once they are published (Harrison et al., 2023).\nPrey and habitat data: Marine mammal prey species (e.g., zooplankton, forage fish) are driven by oceanographic factors and in turn drive mammal distribution, abundance, and behavior. Recent studies of hydrodynamic and oceanographic factors that are impacted by climate change and may also change due to the introduction of offshore wind structures summarize key issues and data gaps:\n\nPotential Hydrodynamic Impacts of Offshore Wind Energy on Nantucket Shoals Regional Ecology: An Evaluation from Wind to Whales (NASEM, 2023)\nOceanographic Effects of Offshore Wind Structures and Their Potential Impacts on the North Atlantic Right Whale and Their Prey (ACP, 2023a)\n\nSeveral sources of prey data exist across multiple groups:\n\nNOAA Fisheries EcoMon Plankton Data\nContinuous Plankton Recorder\nGulf of Maine MBON\nBOEM-funded zooplankton ecology study\nAtlantic Zone Monitoring Program (AZMP) Maritimes Region zooplankton (Canada)\nCenter for Coastal Studies\nNortheast U.S. Shelf LTER\nForage fish distribution models (Friedland et al., 2023)\n\nNorth Atlantic right whale status and trends:\n\nNorth Atlantic right whale Critical Habitat: The NOAA Fisheries Biological Source Document describes these habitat features in detail.

In addition, most marine mammal species are exposed to many other types of stressors in these areas. The cumulative effect of several stressors may create a biologically significant population level response (Kraus et al., 2019a).\nOf the large whale species that are of greatest concern listed in Table 1, baleen whales have typically been prioritized for attention with respect to offshore wind research (Southall et al., 2021a), due to their distribution and abundance in the study area, behavior, and life history characteristics that make them susceptible to some of the specific stressors potentially associated with offshore wind. That being said, the majority of studies describing the effects of construction and operation of windfarms on cetaceans come from Europe, where small odontocetes (dolphins and porpoise mainly) are the most common cetaceans. Avoidance and displacement effects, at ranges up to 10-26 km from the whole footprint of offshore windfarms during construction have been reported (Benhemma Le Gall et al., 2021; Brandt et al., 2018a, 2016; Dähne et al., 2017a, 2013; Graham et al., 2023, 2019). These studies indicate that the distance and duration of avoidance is related to received noise, which is further influenced by source level, sound propagation conditions, hearing range of the studied species, distance to the noise source, duration of exposure, level and type of mitigation and presence of other noise sources like construction vessels. There is variation among studies in the time reported for animal behavior to return to pre-construction levels, from hours (Dähne et al., 2017b) and days (Brandt et al., 2018b) to years (Teilmann and Carstensen, 2012), which also suggest that operation of offshore windfarms may also affect cetacean behavior. Tagging data from Europe around wind energy sites suggest that harbor and grey seals either habituate quickly or may take advantage of the wind farm physical structures as a foraging opportunity (Russell et al., 2016).\nKraus et al. 2019 summarized the potential short-term and long-term effects of offshore wind development on marine mammals and sea turtles in Massachusetts and Rhode Island Wind Energy Areas. The list of potential effects below from this report is relevant to the entire RWSC study area. Any concerns related to marine mammal species that are specific to each subregion will be further described in the following sections of this chapter.\nOverall, climate change increases the uncertainty surrounding marine mammal behavior, distribution and demography, which can abruptly and unexpectedly increases the risks associated with offshore wind development if marine mammals begin to use new areas and habitats or existing habitat more frequently or during different times of year.\nPotential short-term effects of offshore wind construction activities\nPotential short-term effects include noise from pile driving, vessel operating noise, and the increased vessel activity to/from and near turbine fields. These stressors could influence:\n\nDisplacement of marine mammals from wind energy areas\nIncreased risk of vessel strike\nDisruption to critical behaviors of marine mammals such as feeding, socializing, or nursing\nElevation of stress hormone levels in marine mammals\nChanges in vertical distribution, density, or patch structure of zooplankton and/or fish prey\n\nPotential long-term effects of offshore wind operation\nPotential long-term effects include wind turbine presence, and increased vessel activity to/from and near turbine fields. These stressors could influence:\n\nMarine mammal exclusion from or attraction to wind energy areas\nIncreased risk of vessel strike\nChanges to feeding opportunities\nEnhancements to marine productivity due to artificial reef effect around wind turbine foundations\nIncreased risk of entanglement from abandoned, lost, or otherwise discarded fishing gear attached to underwater offshore wind structures"

    "section": "D.3 Recommendations: Marine mammals and offshore wind in the U.S. Atlantic Ocean",
    "text": "D.3 Recommendations: Marine mammals and offshore wind in the U.S. Atlantic Ocean\nThis chapter builds on the research topics and questions related to marine mammals and offshore wind proposed by several groups over the last decade that should be addressed by a regional collaborative (Farmer et al., 2023; Kershaw et al., 2023; Kraus et al., 2019b; NJ RMI, 2021; Regional Synthesis Workgroup of the Environmental Technical Working Group, n.d.; Southall et al., 2021b). The RWSC Marine Mammal Subcommittee considered these previous bodies of work in developing the following list. In doing so, they have also highlighted the following concepts:\n\nFuture work will be aligned and coordinated with research needs and actions described in the NOAA Fisheries and BOEM Draft North Atlantic Right Whale Offshore Wind Strategy (NOAA Fisheries and BOEM, 2022).\nClimate change: Disentangling the impacts to marine mammals from climate change from any potential effects from offshore wind development will be a major challenge. For example, any attempt to establish a “baseline” representative of the past several decades must acknowledge that the environment changed rapidly over that time and continues to change rapidly. In addition, climate change increases the uncertainty surrounding marine mammal behavior, distribution and demography, which can abruptly and unexpectedly increases the risks associated with offshore wind development if marine mammals begin to use new areas and habitats or existing habitat more frequently or during different times of year.\nA key contribution of the RWSC Science Plan is the ability to look across all the various data collection activities and identify opportunities for synthesis.\nAssigning causality to observed changes may not be possible in all studies.\n\n\nD.3.1 Data Collection\nSeveral entities are requiring, funding, and/or advocating for marine mammal research and data collection activities with respect to offshore wind. The Subcommittee strongly recommends that funders ensure that all types of data are collected using consistent methods across locations and projects such that data can be used in other analyses and research, including broad scale analyses of potential impacts across many projects. Individuals and entities should consult with the Marine Mammal Subcommittee prior to collecting marine mammal data with respect to offshore wind to ensure that any new data collection does not duplicate existing efforts and is consistent with the tools and approaches already in use. Any individual or entity may join public Marine Mammal Subcommittee meetings by obtaining meeting links on the RWSC website.\nA combination of methods (visual, acoustic, tagging) is recommended to provide the most complete information and context to marine mammal observations, given the strengths and limitations of each method alone. For example, pairing passive acoustics with visual observations can provide more information about marine mammal behavior at the time vocalizations are recorded.\n\nVisual observations (ship-based, aerial, conventional imagery) are most robust during daylight hours and weather conditions with good visibility. However, these methods only capture marine mammals at or near the surface.\nThermal and infrared imagery increases the amount of time each day that marine mammals can be detected visually. Some of the technologies associated with imagery are being tested by offshore wind developers and other experts.\nPassive acoustics (real-time and archival) can be used to detect marine mammals during all hours of the day, all year long, and during most conditions (high levels of ambient noise could impact detection). However, acoustics tools only detect whales that are vocalizing.\nTagging methods are typically applied to understand fine-scale movement and behavior of individuals. Tags may be difficult to deploy but can provide useful information about an animal’s responses to oceanographic conditions or known stressors that are being measured simultaneously.\n\nBOEM requires various types of marine mammal data collection and monitoring as part of the approval process for each offshore wind project’s Construction and Operations Plans (COPs). These activities may include:\n\nVisual and passive acoustic monitoring of vessel transit corridors to/from the project site\nPassive acoustic monitoring and visual surveys before and during activities such as pile driving and geophysical surveys\nLong-term/archival passive acoustic monitoring to record ambient noise and marine mammal species before, during, and for a specified period of time after construction\n\nNOAA, BOEM, and several states are also funding the deployment of passive acoustic monitoring sensors in the RWSC study area. Deployment locations and data management are being coordinated through the RWSC Marine Mammal Subcommittee (visit https://rwsc.org/pam for the latest information). The recently completed Power analysis for optimal design of a passive acoustic monitoring network for US east coast offshore wind (Chudzinska and Thomas, 2023) highlighted several data gaps that if filled, would improve the ability to assess the statistical power of the regional passive acoustic monitoring network:\n\nImprove estimates of acoustic detection rates and cue rates of baleen whales during non-construction conditions.\nImprove dose-response curves by obtaining in-situ behavioral data at offshore wind construction sites on baleen whale responses to pile driving noise. This would require collecting a range of data types including PAM and visual observations (aerial or ship-based).\nExpand passive acoustic monitoring outside of wind energy areas, especially along the shelf break, including using gliders and real-time systems.\n\nAdditional recommendations for the implementation of a regional scale passive acoustic monitoring network include:\n\nCharacterize baseline ambient sound and sound/noise during all phases of development, leveraging the regional passive acoustic monitoring network.\nExpand passive acoustic monitoring outside of wind energy areas, especially along the shelf break, including using gliders and real-time systems.\nTo the extent practicable, ensure alignment between archival and real-time deployments. Ensure that whale detection from real-time systems can be folded into analyses and data products that also leverage archival detection.\nCouple aerial/visual monitoring with acoustic monitoring to address the issues above and better link the resulting observational datasets.\nCo-deploy acoustic telemetry receivers to build out a telemetry receiver network, and other sensors as practicable.\n\nThe Subcommittee recommends the following regional-scale data collection efforts:\n\n(Cross taxa) Leveraging BOEM and NOAA’s ongoing efforts, ensure that the required Protected Species Observer data collected by offshore wind companies during construction and operations via Pile Driving Monitoring Plans and Vessel Strike Avoidance Plans (and any other mitigation plans) follows a consistent reporting approach and is eventually submitted to a Master Protected Species Observer Sightings Database for use in marine mammal analyses and research.\nEnsure that other marine mammal and environmental data collection required by the agencies during installation (e.g., sound fields, visual monitoring, PAM, thermal/infrared camera systems) are collected using consistent methods such that data can be used in other analyses and research including broader scale analyses of potential impacts across many projects.\n(Cross-taxa) Continue regional scale protected species and habitat data collection activities through the Atlantic Marine Assessment Program for Protected Species (AMAPPS), Ecosystem Monitoring Survey; NOAA Fisheries North Atlantic Right Whale Aerial Surveys, NOAA Fisheries Marine Mammal and Sea Turtle Aerial Surveys, NOAA Fisheries Marine Mammal, Sea Turtle, and Seabird ship-based surveys; NOAA Fisheries Seal aerial abundance surveys. Advance the NOAA Fisheries and BOEM Survey Mitigation Strategy (Hare et al., 2022) to ensure that site-specific and regional scale studies are put in the context of population trends and ecosystem conditions.\n(Cross-taxa) Coordinate regular high-definition aerial surveys that cover multiple lease areas using the same tools and methods. This effort should leverage the considerable amount of high-definition aerial photography data collected during site assessment by multiple offshore wind developers, and the Southern New England megafauna aerial surveys that have occurred consistently since 2011.\nCollect marine mammal behavioral and health data through tagging and visual observations to determine how individuals interact with wind farm structures and whether changes to foraging, socializing, or reproduction are occurring.\nIn collaboration with NOAA Fisheries, continue and expand stranding data collection and analysis with respect to stranding and mortality data time series analysis for the U.S. Atlantic Ocean.\nMonitor entanglement with subsea structure of floating offshore wind structures and monitor secondary entanglement where derelict fishing gear/marine debris may attach to subsurface offshore wind structures.\nCoordinate with the Northeastern Regional Association of Coastal and Ocean Observing Systems (NERACOOS), Mid-Atlantic Regional Association of Coastal Ocean Observing Systems (MARACOOS), and Southeastern Coastal Ocean Observing Regional Association (SECOORA) to advance oceanographic and biological data collection and use in marine mammal research.\nLeverage existing ocean observing platforms or add new ocean observing assets for marine mammal monitoring.\nWork with the Habitat & Ecosystem Subcommittee to ensure that key oceanographic and habitat data are collected and available as data products for use in marine mammal studies and as model covariates.\nWork with the Habitat & Ecosystem Subcommittee to determine whether offshore wind structures alter hydrodynamics, stratification, and mixing, and/or prey distribution and abundance.\nContinue to collect data across the region that allows analysis and synthesis of prey fields. Develop a coordinated regional scale zooplankton monitoring and mapping effort that builds off of and links existing surveys and studies including EcoMon, Continuous Plankton Recorder, the Gulf of Maine MBON, BOEM-funded Zooplankton Ecology study, Canadian AZMP, Center for Coastal Studies, Northeast U.S. Shelf LTER, and projects conducted by Stony Brook University and Rutgers University to establish a broader ecosystem observing system, synthesize patterns, and identify trends and linkages across trophic levels.\n\nThere is a need to advance technologies that improve marine mammal detection during all phases of offshore wind development, and to ensure that the performance of new technologies is evaluated consistently (see Technology chapter recommendations): Chapter 10\n\nDevelop, evaluate performance, and apply existing and emerging technologies that enhance marine mammal detection, including thermal cameras, infrared cameras, passive acoustics systems, and systems that integrate multiple methods for use during construction and operational monitoring and mitigation. Test “smart” mitigation methods triggered by marine mammal presence as determined by these systems.\nAdvance quieting technologies meant to mitigate construction noise (pile driving, vessel traffic) and operational noise (vessel traffic, operational vibratory sound).\nDevelop and deploy safe long-duration satellite tagging telemetry technology for tracking high-resolution movements of marine mammals in and around offshore wind structures.\nImprove analysis of monitoring data through artificial intelligence, automated acoustic, and image processing, and near real-time data availability.\n(Cross taxa) Develop and test eDNA assays/surveys/sampling regimes to understand efficacy of use developing indices of occurrence/abundance, including testing the effect of carcasses in the environment on eDNA detection.\n\nView ongoing and planned data collection activities for marine mammals in each subregion of the RWSC study area in the RWSC Offshore Wind and Wildlife Research Database. Based on those activities, plans for new data collection should consider the following:\nThe Gulf of Maine has long represented important feeding grounds for baleen whales from late fall to early spring. A resident population of Harbor porpoise is present in the coastal/nearshore areas of the Gulf of Maine from July to September. Almost all of the Gulf of Maine subregion is critical habitat (Northeastern U.S. foraging area) for North Atlantic right whales. Given that offshore wind development areas are still being identified in this subregion, baseline data collection should seek to characterize fine scale spatial and temporal habitat use. Studies of impacts specific to floating offshore wind (e.g., secondary entanglement), including modeling, should be coordinated through the Subcommittee. Cape Cod Bay, as a historical whale aggregation location, could serve as a sentinel site or control site to monitor potential population-level impacts to whales.\nIn Southern New England, known whale foraging hotspots (e.g., Nantucket Shoals) should be monitored using multiple methods to understand potential changes in behavior and habitat use. Studies of hydrodynamics and physical oceanography at the turbine- and wind farm-scales should seek to disentangle climate change drivers from offshore wind development and understand any changes that may impact whale prey (ACP, 2023b).\nWhale and dolphin sightings in the NY/NJ Bight have increased recently and includes increases in juvenile humpback whales in coastal waters, likely due to an increase in their menhaden prey. These whales may be particularly vulnerable to vessel strike due to their behavior and high density and speed of vessels in nearshore waters of this region (Stepanuk et al., 2021). Studies of whale-prey relationships and potential displacement from offshore wind areas in this region should be tailored to this context and capture rapidly changing ecosystem conditions and existing human uses in this area.\nThe U.S. Central Atlantic includes small resident populations of bottlenose dolphins, and large whales occur here and in the U.S. Southeast Atlantic at relatively lower densities than the other subregions. Data collection strategies and studies should be designed with the lower expected densities in mind. Both regions are important migratory routes, and the U.S. Southeast Atlantic contains critical habitat for North Atlantic right whale calving. Pregnant and nursing North Atlantic right whales and their calves are particularly vulnerable to vessel strikes in the Southeast U.S. from November to April annually because of the shallow bathymetry, the whales’ tendency to float at or just below the surface, and their long residency times in Southeast U.S. waters (approximately 2 months) (Cusano et al., 2019; Gowan and Ortega-Ortiz, 2014; Krzystan AM et al., 2018a). Calving females and their calves may also be at greater risk of exposure to acoustic impacts because of their long residency times (Krzystan AM et al., 2018b). More information is needed about the ways that reproductively active female right whales respond (or do not respond) to physical structures, noise, and vessels in their environment before wind projects are implemented in the Southeast right whale calving habitat. Characterizations of marine mammal distribution, abundance, and movement should continue in these subregions using multiple methods as offshore wind planning and development advances.\n\n\nD.3.2 Data Analysis\nData analyses should inform where new data collection is needed, characterize oceanographic and habitat drivers of marine mammal distribution, abundance, and behavior, seek to assess whether offshore wind is causing any observed changes, and evaluate the efficacy of monitoring and mitigation strategies. The Subcommittee is especially interested in studies that seek to distinguish between climate change-driven shifts in marine mammal distribution, abundance, and behavior and changes that may be driven by offshore wind construction and operation. Related changes of interest include:\n\nWhether construction activities displace or attract marine mammals\nWhether offshore wind structures displace or attract marine mammals\nWhether marine mammal feeding is altered due to changes to hydrodynamics or prey distribution/abundances caused by offshore wind structures\n\nIndividuals and entities should consult with the Marine Mammal Subcommittee prior to conducting analyses of marine mammal data with respect to offshore wind to ensure that the study leverages all of the available data and contributes to addressing the key recommendations described below to the extent possible.\nIn particular, researchers are strongly encouraged to leverage extensive existing and long-term data sources. These include but are not limited to AMAPPS, NOAA Fisheries North Atlantic Right Whale Aerial Surveys, Southern New England Aerial Megafauna Surveys, long-term/archival PAM, as well as shorter-duration observational studies (aerial, boat-based, tagging) as foundational elements of any analysis.\nThe following types of analyses are recommended:\n\nConduct a synthetic baseline assessment of marine mammals over the past several decades to characterize pre-development levels of spatial and temporal variability in marine mammal distribution and abundance patterns, from which to measure and assess any potential changes after the onset of offshore wind construction and regional-scale operation activities. Integrate density modeling and/or visual survey data, passive acoustic monitoring data, tagging data, oceanography/habitat data, and climate data to characterize pre-development levels of spatial and temporal variability in marine mammal distribution and abundance patterns.\nContinue to update and improve marine mammal density models. Use outputs to understand drivers of marine mammal distribution and movement and to assess/detect change, displacement, and/or potential impacts. Periodically evaluate model performance and use validation and evaluation results to continually inform and advance model/framework development and applications.\n\nIntegrate the latest observational and environmental data every 2-3 years.\nIntegrate data from multiple additional methods (strandings, digital aerial surveys, passive acoustic data, tagging) and covariates (oceanographic and prey distribution). Apply results to inform research designs, determine baseline abundance/distribution estimates, best practices, etc.\nConsider how to structure future model “eras” to reflect offshore wind pre-construction and construction/operation.\nThe modeling framework should be scalable to individual projects and the whole region such that individual project-specific outputs could be pooled into regional-scale versions of the model.\n\nRepeat a power analysis to optimize the design of the long-term archival passive acoustic monitoring network every 3-5 years. Ensure that new monitoring assets and analysis results are accounted for and that existing or new hypotheses and questions can be addressed by the regional network.\nInform and evaluate the effectiveness of mitigation strategies meant to minimize impacts resulting from increases in vessel traffic (i.e., noise, collision, displacement) from construction and maintenance of offshore wind projects.\n\nDevelop or update existing vessel and marine mammal co-occurrence models with information from the offshore wind industry regarding vessel types and numbers. Validate models with AIS and effort-corrected whale sightings data.\nConduct studies to assess the effectiveness of mitigation strategies such as speed restrictions, establishment of traffic corridors, etc.\n\nModel and assess entanglement risks associated with floating offshore wind.\nBuild off Project WOW and apply lessons learned to studies in and around other lease areas outside Southern New England and NY/NJ Bight. Use Project WOW Frameworks to identify stressors, species, and geographic areas to conduct assessments of displacement, attraction, or other changes to wildlife abundance, distribution, behavior, and/or health.\nIntegrate multiple types of data (e.g., acoustic, visual, stable isotopes, bycatch estimates, vessel trip reports) to understand potential changes in marine mammal feeding behaviors.\nDetermine whether prey distribution, abundance and/or behavior is altered due to hydrodynamic changes caused by offshore wind structures and from EMF/cables (heat and electromagnetic field).\nScope studies of EMF and marine mammals. Include studies of whether animals can detect EMF, what the sensing capabilities are, and over what distance.\n\n\n\nD.3.3 Data Management\nUnderstanding marine mammal movement and behavior near offshore wind developments will require close coordination among researchers, state and federal agencies, and industry.  The Marine Mammal Subcommittee will work with individuals and entities who conduct marine mammals and offshore wind monitoring and research to ensure that data are collected and stored in consistent formats that allow comparisons and pooling across individual projects in the RWSC study area.  This standardization is intended to support regional-scale assessments and the development and maintenance of regional data products and tools (e.g., marine mammal density models).\nTo support these efforts, the Marine Mammal Subcommittee recommends: \n\nMaintenance of an up-to-date resource list of recommended repositories, data and metadata standards, guidance, and protocols for use by all data collectors.  The current recommended resources are detailed in the table below. \nDevelopment of standard language for inclusion in requests for proposals and funding agreements to encourage or require the use of recommended resources. \nEstablishment of data sharing frameworks to appropriately manage access to sensitive industry-collected datasets necessary for research (e.g., acoustic data, Protected Species Observer data).\nCollaboratively establish timelines for marine mammal detection data upload and dissemination, especially through public platforms and apps, e.g., WhaleAlert, WhaleMap.\n\nThe following table lists the repositories and standards that are recommended for use in marine mammal data collection and identifies data types for which no or limited data management capacity (i.e., standard repositories and guidance) currently exists.\nTable 2.

    "text": "E.1 Introduction\nThis chapter of the RWSC Science Plan addresses bird research and associated scientific needs in the context of offshore wind development. The plan is intended to reflect the research and data collection needs of RWSC's four Sectors with input from the science community. The plan will provide a path forward to ensure appropriate data collection protocols and standards are in place to support scientific research; this document can also provide a framework that can aid RWSC participants in coordinating and aligning funding to carry out necessary scientific activities.\nThis plan benefits greatly from the contributions of RWSC Bird & Bat Subcommittee members; researchers, managers, and other practitioners who joined Subcommittee calls; and the many scientists who conducted research or developed reference materials referenced throughout this plan.\nFollowing this introduction, the first section of the chapter discusses the species of birds which occur within the RWSC Study Area. The species section is followed by a brief section summarizing primary sources of information about species' distributions. The next section of this chapter discusses potential effects (negative or positive) of offshore wind development on bird species. The following section summarizes common field research methods for the study of birds, with a focus on the offshore environment. The subsequent section addresses the major research topics relevant to birds in the context of offshore wind development.  The remainder of the chapter addresses recommended science actions of value to the four sectors that make up RWSC (state and federal agencies, eNGOs, and the offshore wind industry), in the context of recent, ongoing, and pending scientific activities relevant to recommended actions."

    "section": "E.2 Species",
    "text": "E.2 Species\nThis chapter addresses bird species (Class Aves) which could be at risk from offshore wind development occurring in the Northwest Atlantic within U.S. waters.  For the purposes of this plan, the geographic area of interest comprises the Atlantic Coast of the United States, extending from Maine's northern border with Canada south to the Florida Keys, and from coastal areas extending 200 nm east into the ocean, including state waters (3 nm from shore) and federal waters of the Outer Continental Shelf (3-200 nm). This area is referred to in this plan as the RWSC Study Area. \nHundreds of bird species occur within this area.  At least 416 native species are regularly found in the 14 coastal states of the U.S. Atlantic Coast, based on state eBird lists, U.S. Atlantic Coast ranges in Birds of the World, and Information for Planning and Consultation (IPaC) identifications of birds using North Atlantic offshore areas.  Many of these bird species inhabit the RWSC Study Area throughout the year.  Others may occur in this area exclusively during the breeding or nonbreeding season, or utilize the Atlantic Flyway for migratory movements between Canada and the Caribbean, Central America, and South America (see (AFSI, 2015; Newton, 2007; USFWS, 2023a)).\nA number of these species can be expected to experience impacts from offshore wind development, including collision fatalities, displacement, attraction, barrier effects associated with avoidance, and effects on abiotic habitat features and prey populations (see (SEER, 2022)); indirect effects of offshore wind energy development, like climate change mitigation, can also be expected. While the focus of this plan is on offshore impacts of offshore wind development, potential onshore impacts of offshore wind on bird species are also possible. For example, excavation efforts where transmission cables are coming ashore from offshore facilities could affect beach-nesting birds.  Therefore, bird species which primarily or solely occur in the onshore environment along the U.S. Atlantic Coast are also included within the scope of this plan, although they are not the focus of the bulk of this chapter.\nAll 416 species that occur in the RWSC Study Area are included in RWSC's Bird List, a spreadsheet intended to be updated regularly to provide a complete listing of and basic information about the current regulatory and conservation status of relevant bird species, as well as characteristics relevant to exposure and vulnerability to offshore wind impacts. Vagrants, rare visitors to U.S. Atlantic waters, and non-native species are not included in the list. \nFor additional summary information about the types of birds that occur in the RWSC Study Area, see RWSC's Bird Descriptions by Category [forthcoming in 2024]. Bird \"categories\" are loosely based on taxonomy, but also incorporate considerations relevant to offshore wind. This resource provides basic information about categories of birds and their life histories as relevant to their exposure and potential vulnerability to offshore wind development.  These sections also address other conservation threats facing these species, which could be of interest in investigating potential impacts of offshore wind or offsetting its effects.  Species at particular risk from offshore wind development due to their life histories or conservation status are highlighted. \nWithin this plan, some science recommendations are discussed within the context of five subregions of the RWSC Study Area: the Gulf of Maine, Southern New England, New York/New Jersey Bight, U.S. Central Atlantic, and U.S. Southeast Atlantic (see Chapter 1).  Avian assemblages and ecology may vary considerably over this geographic area.  The Gulf of Maine subregion, located at the northern edge of the Study Area, with deeper water depths and a complex coastal topography (many islands, peninsulas, and inlets), includes a suite of species adapted to colder waters and more northern climes. Several alcid species breed along the Maine coast but are not found breeding in other states; colonies of breeding Arctic Terns and Black Terns, likewise, are only found in Maine. At the opposite end of the Study Area, many birds of more tropical regions, like whistling-ducks, Limpkins, and American Flamingos, are only found in Florida. \n\nE.2.1 Regulatory Status\nMany bird species are protected via federal regulations.  Important and relevant federal laws include the following:\nEndangered Species Act (ESA).Currently 16 bird species that regularly occur in the RWSC Study Area are listed as Threatened or Endangered under the federal ESA (see RWSC Bird List), including two shorebird species (the Piping Plover, Red Knot) and three seabirds (Roseate Tern, Bermuda Petrel, Band-rumped Storm-petrel).  In addition, the Black-capped Petrel has been proposed for listing as Threatened ((USFWS, 2023b)).  The ESA places strict limits on the import, export, sale, possession, transportation, or \"take\" of listed species, with \"take\" defined as \"to harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect, or to attempt to engage in any such conduct.\" The ESA also allows for the designation of critical habitat for a species and prohibits the destruction of that habitat.\nMigratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA). Nearly all the birds that occur in the RWSC Study Area are afforded protection under the MBTA (see RWSC Bird List).  The MBTA was enacted in 1918 to implement four international conservation treaties that the U.S. entered into with Canada, Mexico, Japan, and Russia (several of which were amended in more recent years). The MBTA covers over 1,000 bird species and is intended to ensure the sustainability of their populations. The MBTA prohibits the take (including killing, capturing, selling, trading, and transport) of protected migratory bird species without prior authorization by the USFWS.  Of greatest relevance to offshore wind development is the prohibition of incidental take, that is the taking or killing of migratory birds that results from, but is not the purpose of, a lawful activity (USFWS, 2021). The USFWS prioritizes for enforcement incidental take that results from activities by a public- or private-sector entity that are otherwise legal and foreseeable, and occurs where known general or activity-specific beneficial practices were not implemented (USFWS, 2021).  The USFWS is currently in a rulemaking process as the Service considers developing proposed regulations to authorize the incidental take of migratory birds (USFWS, 2023b).\nBald and Golden Eagle Protection Act (BGEPA).The BGEPA is more limited in scope than the two proceeding regulations.  It protects Bald and Golden Eagles, both of which occur in the RWSC Study Area, prohibiting take of individuals, as well as their parts (e.g., feathers), nests, or eggs.  The Act defines “take” as “pursue, shoot, shoot at, poison, wound, kill, capture, trap, collect, molest or disturb.”  Regulations further define “disturb” as \"to agitate or bother a bald or golden eagle to a degree that causes, or is likely to cause, based on the best scientific information available, 1) injury to an eagle, 2) a decrease in its productivity, by substantially interfering with normal breeding, feeding, or sheltering behavior, or 3) nest abandonment, by substantially interfering with normal breeding, feeding, or sheltering behavior” (50 CFR 22.6).\nIn addition to federal regulations, most states maintain a list of rare species which are afforded special protections under a state-level Endangered Species Act or other state statute.  Over 150 bird species are protected by these state laws in the 14 states of the RWSC Study Area.  Individual State Wildlife Action Plans also identify Species of Greatest Conservation Need (SGCN) which serve as foci for research and conservation efforts.  At least two-thirds of U.S. Atlantic Coast birds are listed as SGCN in one or more states (see RWSC Bird List).\n\n\nE.2.2 Defining Focal Species\n\n\n\n\nAFSI, 2015.
