    "text": "Welcome\nThis is the website for the first Integrated Science Plan for Offshore Wind, Wildlife, and Habitat in U.S. Atlantic Waters.\nThe RWSC Steering Committee, the four sectors, and hosts—the Northeast Regional Ocean Council and Mid-Atlantic Regional Council on the Ocean with the Coastal States Stewardship Foundation—collaboratively funded and developed the Science Plan to inform future data collection and research and to describe a framework for collaboration to address those needs.\nThe RWSC Science Plan presents recommendations for data management, data collection, and data analysis activities and capacity across wildlife species groups and topics including marine mammals, birds, bats, sea turtles, protected fish, oceanography, seafloor habitat, and technology. These recommendations were developed by six Subcommittees comprised of hundreds of experts from the four sectors, academia, and the private sector, and were refined by feedback received during a public comment period over the summer.  A primary focus of the Science Plan is to encourage the use of consistent methods and data standards across research activities to allow for the assessment of regional scale patterns and the development and maintenance of regional data products and tools."

    "text": "Summary of Subcommittee Recommendations\nThis section consolidates the detailed recommendations made by each Subcommittee in the Science Plan to address data gaps and needs. Each Subcommittee’s chapter provides more information about the geographies where certain activities should occur, ecological and logistical considerations for implementing recommendations, and the entities who are leading existing work. The Sector Caucuses expect that to implement these recommendations, many different science entities may take on roles to fund, guide, or otherwise support the work needed to address the recommendations based on an entity’s expertise, capacity, and existing data collection, research, and data management portfolio.\n\nLeverage the substantial existing data management infrastructure within the federal government and private sector. Ensure that agencies and entities responsible for managing and funding existing repositories coordinate via RWSC to understand capacity needs and usability given the volume of offshore wind and wildlife data being collected.\nApply consistent data collection, QA/QC, data management, data storage, and data sharing guidance for all offshore wind and wildlife studies, as developed or recommended by each Subcommittee.\nEstablish specific collaboratives, data sharing agreements, and tools for offshore wind companies, contractors, and researchers to appropriately access key industry-collected datasets for use in decision-making and research.\nFund data collection and research tailored to the mix of species present and the need for baseline data in each subregion, according to each chapter in the Science Plan.\n\nEncourage new data collection activities to align with the objectives of the NOAA Fisheries and BOEM Federal Survey Mitigation Strategy.\nContinue baseline data collection for all species in all geographies and improve collection for species that are relatively data-poor, including all sea turtles, bats, and protected fish species. Monitor species’ movement in, and use of, wind energy areas consistently across the region.\nBaseline data collection should continue in the Gulf of Maine, U.S. Central Atlantic, and U.S. Southeast Atlantic where construction is likely a few years away. To understand potential impacts from the construction of the first commercial-scale developments in Southern New England and New York/New Jersey Bight, conduct project-level studies using consistent methods and approaches.\nEncourage consistent methods and approaches to all individual data collection, data analysis, and data management efforts to support regional scale assessments and the development and maintenance of regional data products and tools.\n\nContinue to the lead coordination of research planning, data collection, data analysis, and data management for wildlife surveys and sensor networks throughout the study area funded by multiple entities that benefit from regional collaboration:\n\nLong-term archival passive acoustic monitoring for marine mammal monitoring and soundscape characterization.\nMotus (radio telemetry) receiver network and tagging efforts for birds and bats.\nAcoustic telemetry receiver network and tagging efforts for sea turtles and protected fish species.\nRepeated, regular, high-definition aerial photography surveys that cover multiple contiguous and proximate lease areas and characterize multiple taxa.\nSeafloor habitat data compilation, the identification of sensitive hard bottom and coral habitats, and the development of regional-scale habitat maps.\nDeployment of multi-sensor oceanographic and ecological buoys in areas of high biodiversity and/or habitat value.\nConsistent performance evaluation of new technologies for mitigation and long-term monitoring of protected species.\n\nOptimize the design of surveys and sensor networks to detect broad scale species displacement, changes in abundance, and/or changes in behavior using power analyses or other statistical tools.\nContinue to update existing species distribution models (marine mammals, seabirds, sea turtles) and develop new models with the latest at-sea observations, movement data, and environmental data every 2-3 years. Produce and keep updated a standardized set of regional seafloor habitat and oceanographic data products for use as covariates in species distribution modeling and other analyses.\nAs per the National Academies of Sciences recommendations, conduct oceanographic observations and modeling to differentiate changes to hydrodynamics from climate change and offshore wind development at turbine, windfarm, and broader scales.\nExpand on and link existing studies of prey species, including plankton, across the Atlantic to establish a broader ecosystem wide observing system that can detect patterns, trends, and trophic linkages.\nFor studies of potential impacts, follow existing guidance and best practices for study design and analysis compiled by the Subcommittees for consistency and leverage the opportunity to combine individual studies into broader regional scale analyses.\nAdvance technologies to improve wildlife detection and impact mitigation and ensure consistent technology performance evaluation."

    "text": "Implementing the Science Plan – a Framework for Collaboration\nTo ensure that the data collection and research efforts recommended in the Science Plan are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable2 by anyone, the four Sectors have developed a voluntary framework for collaboration through RWSC. This framework has three primary goals:\n\nCoordinate regional research on offshore wind and wildlife through the RWSC, regardless of funding source, recipient(s), or funding structure.\nEnsure that data collection and research methods and products meet the needs of decision-makers, are scientifically sound, standardized, and are made available for use as soon as possible to inform and improve decision-making.\nCommunicate the impact of individual and collaborative research.\n\nThe four sectors welcome and encourage participation from all entities and individuals in implementing this Science Plan, especially via expert Subcommittee meetings3. To assist in the implementation of the Science Plan, the RWSC will maintain the Offshore Wind & Wildlife Research Database and continue to provide tools and forums for research planning, discussions, and collaboration among all participants. All are encouraged to participate in implementing the Science Plan by:\n\nMaintaining situational awareness of data collection and research activities to identify opportunities for collaboration, consistency, and efficiency. This can be accomplished in part by participating regularly in RWSC Sector Caucus and expert Subcommittee meetings and by requiring relevant grantees, contractors, and researchers to share project information with the RWSC. Several RWSC participants have noted the value of Subcommittee meetings as forums for sharing research plans, discussing emerging issues, and working together across sectors to advance Science Plan objectives. The Subcommittees will continue to meet regularly to share information on the latest study results, ongoing and planned research and data collection, and to periodically review data management infrastructure needs and workflows. Entities will consult with the relevant RWSC Subcommittee(s), as appropriate, prior to new data collection (to ensure consistency and reduce duplication) and analysis (to facilitate access to the available data) and share detail about where and when activities take place to avoid conflicts. RWSC will facilitate this objective via the Offshore Wind & Wildlife Research Database, web mapping tools, and a data catalog (in development).\nCollaboratively implementing and requiring the use of best practices for data collection, QA/QC, data management and storage as specified in this Science Plan. Each Subcommittee has recommended or required practices for each relevant data type or data collection method in the Science Plan. To encourage uptake and consistent use of these practices, the RWSC will provide suggested language, agreed to by the Sector Caucuses, around data management and sharing for participants to use in their own requests for proposals and agreements.\nParticipating in regular discussion and adaptation of research priorities. RWSC provides a forum for partners to identify data and research needs based on current data gaps, new research results, emerging decision-making needs, and available funding. To facilitate an adaptive approach to prioritizing the recommendations in the Science Plan, RWSC will convene the sectors annually to review and discuss funding priorities. Discussions will be informed by the expert Subcommittees’ work, collaborative workshops, and agreed upon prioritization criteria.\nAligning funds and developing collaborative funding plans. Coordination through the Subcommittees and during annual funding strategy sessions provides opportunities for participants to align funds to address Science Plan objectives and ensure consistency with agency science plans and guidance. RWSC provides the mechanisms for pooling funds to accomplish shared priorities when practical.\n\nThe four sectors will reassess the Science Plan and framework for collaboration every five years to ensure its continued utility and relevance in light of new information and changes in the rapidly evolving offshore wind industry. The RWSC will track progress on Science Plan recommendations annually.\nThe four sectors also envision and welcome uses of this Science Plan for purposes other than their direct coordination on offshore wind and wildlife data collection and research in U.S. Atlantic waters:\n\nThe Science Plan and its development process can be used as an example for regional offshore wind science entities in other geographies.\nThe greater scientific community can use this plan to shape their own research objectives and inform their funding decisions related to offshore wind and wildlife efforts.\nThe RWSC Science Plan could be used to support multi-sector collaborations to advance career workforce development programs for ecological and biological monitoring roles by serving as a guide to identify the scientific disciplines, the types of roles and the skills (including the educational requirements) necessary to address the research questions4. Building on the administration’s Justice40 objectives and state-level commitments, the STEM ecological and biological career workforce investments should be targeted to benefit communities historically underrepresented in the scientific community that have been most impacted by environmental harms by developing a Bluegreen Career Map with multiple training and employment entry and exit points."

    "section": "Summary",
    "text": "Summary\nData governance and data management are essential to achieving the RWSC’s goals and the research described in this Science Plan. Data governance encompasses the purpose and processes for collecting and using data, policies such as contract terms and data licenses, and frameworks for technical implementation. Data management executes and informs data governance, supporting the shared goals and agreements with standards, best practices, documentation, and infrastructure. The two practices are complementary and need to operate in tandem, in ways that are responsive to program demands and the capacity of the RWSC community.\nDuring the 2023 Science Plan review, the RWSC held multiple discussions on data governance and management, including a half-day workshop on September 8, 2023. As a result of these discussions, as well as comments received on the draft Science Plan, parts of the original Data Management Chapter have been distributed into relevant Subcommittee chapters while other parts are now incorporated here. This reflects a general desire to divide roles and responsibilities between the RWSC Steering Committee (via a newly created Data Governance Subcommittee) and the expert Subcommittees such that:\n\nThe Data Governance Subcommittee (DGSC) oversees issues that cross disciplines and taxa, like common data sharing terms for contracts, tools for sharing sensitive data, requirements for RWSC-funded projects, or setting a “floor” for data to be included in the RWSC catalog.\nOther Subcommittees and data leads for individual projects hold the primary responsibility for data management of project data and data workflows. This includes applying the recommendations in the Subcommittee chapters for metadata standards, preferred repositories, and data stewardship through the data lifecycle.\n\nThis chapter focuses on the role of data governance and management across projects and Subcommittees—at the RWSC DGSC level—and describes how both the DGSC and other Subcommittees might each advance these efforts. More detailed information on data management for specific data types can be found in each of the Subcommittee chapters, including recommendations for study design, data collection sheet standardization, and other taxa- or method-specific data standards.\nThe RWSC Steering Committee will set up a Data Governance Subcommittee (DGSC) by Spring 2024. The initial scope of work for that group will include:\n\nMapping the offshore wind & wildlife data ecosystem\nDeveloping common policies, minimum data standards, and guidance for data management\nCreating a data catalog\nBuilding network capacity to steward unique or orphaned data\nProviding general data governance support and education\n\nOnce established, the DGSC should refine these goals and develop a workplan for the first year, focusing on tasks that are essential, have high levels of demand, or where DGSC efforts can have high impact. Data governance and management are applicable to every RWSC participant. The remainder of this chapter provides guidance and resources for both the DGSC and anyone looking to implement data governance and management."

    "section": "2.1 Introduction to Data Governance & Management",
    "text": "2.1 Introduction to Data Governance & Management\nFor more background and context, read the Data Governance & Data Management Appendix.\nThe RWSC’s mission is:\n\n“To collaboratively and effectively conduct and coordinate relevant, credible, and efficient regional monitoring and research of wildlife and marine ecosystems that supports the advancement of environmentally responsible and cost-efficient offshore wind power development activities in U.S. Atlantic waters.”\n\nAchieving this mission requires attention to the way monitoring is carried out, by whom, and how results are validated and shared. Delivering efficiencies and coordinating data from collection to research products, across diverse and widespread efforts, will require data governance and management. Well-planned data governance will also help position the RWSC as a trusted resource for research guidance and information.\nData governance focuses on how decisions are made about data and how people and processes are expected to behave in relation to data, including configuring technical infrastructure (Sebastian-Coleman, 2018). Data governance can be created through international agreements, national laws, or implemented at an organizational or project level (Brous et al., 2016; MacFeely et al., 2022). Well-designed data governance supports effective, privacy-protecting data sharing and increases the value and impact of data through access and reuse (Abraham et al., 2019). This is particularly important for environmental data efforts (Fritzenkötter et al., 2022), like the RWSC, where analyses could involve data from a wide range of sources, such as compliance data shared with government agencies, data collected by wind energy companies and their contractors, independent and academic researchers, nonprofit organizations, and other future collaborators. Each of these contributors needs to be confident in how their data will be used and have the capacity to make informed decisions about data sharing, understanding both the potential benefits and risks.\nData governance and management are important to consider at every step of the data lifecycle1. The Science Plan lays out research goals which rely on collaboration across a network of partners and projects. Each of these partnerships and projects may be at a different stage of their data lifecycle. Science Plan participants shared examples of data flows where there was a lack of clarity about how data would be structured or transmitted, inconsistent documentation of data practices, and questions about whether partners had the right agreements in place to allow data sharing. These are the types of questions data governance and management can answer, and the ideal time to discuss these topics is before data collection starts. This is why it is critical for the DGSC and other Subcommittees to coordinate on data governance and management, connecting the project-level guidance in the Subcommittee chapters to the broader data integration work of the DGSC.\nU.S. federal agencies, Atlantic coast states, and offshore wind companies are all funding individual data collection and research activities. Some of these activities are conducted collaboratively but the majority are funded, scoped, and managed under the purview of a single funder or entity. In its role as a coordinator, the RWSC can provide guidance and support for consistency across data efforts and partners, including sharing standards and best practices such as New York’s Wildlife Data Standardization and Sharing report (NYSERDA, 2021).\nCollaboration takes time and resources, and it is essential to the success of the Science Plan. By planning for data governance and management at the RWSC level, not just at the individual research project level, the RWSC can identify where best to invest time and resources to achieve the collective goals of the offshore wind and wildlife community. The RWSC can continue its approach of operating transparently by documenting how tools were chosen, how often templates or protocols will be revised, and other decisions about data. Being open about how these decisions are made builds trust in the data systems used by the RWSC and the data products produced (Lin et al., 2020). Finally, program-level data governance and management can create efficiencies and incentives, like improving data discoverability and access, reducing duplicative research, or increasing the visibility of RWSC science so funders and researchers get citable “credit” for their work generating data and data products."

    "section": "2.2 Implementing Data Governance & Management",
    "text": "2.2 Implementing Data Governance & Management\nThe DGSC will be the primary home for data governance in the RWSC. The recommendations below form an initial scope for the work of the DGSC. Once established, the DGSC should refine its scope and workplan with an eye on:\n\nWhat is absolutely essential (e.g., guidance for RWSC-supported projects, minimum data standards to make a data catalog operational).\nWhat has high levels of demand (e.g., templates for contract and policy language).\nWhere RWSC has unique value (e.g., enabling sharing of sensitive data).\nWhat has high impact (e.g., removes a critical data bottleneck).\n\n\n1 - Mapping the offshore wind & wildlife data ecosystem\nThe offshore wind and wildlife data ecosystem encompasses all the data necessary to answer the questions in the RWSC Science Plan; the agencies, organizations, and individuals that created the data; the data hosts or locations; and the networks that connect them. A data ecosystem’s interconnections are core to its value. If data discovery is difficult or data cannot move from one node to another, the data ecosystem will not be as effective or efficient. Figure 1 provides a high-level concept of the data ecosystem and how elements could be connected to deliver Science Plan products, with a focus on data sources, ownership, and control.\nDGSC roles:\n\nLead development of the data ecosystem map.\nReview data flows described in Subcommittee chapters and request additional information from Subcommittee leads and partners as needed.\nIdentify common bottlenecks or barriers across data types and sources that could be addressed by consistent guidance, policy, workflows, or other tools from the RWSC.\nEncourage repositories in the data ecosystem to adopt a consistent Atlantic offshore wind “identifier” for data collected in and around Atlantic WEAs.\nConsider how the existing RWSC database of relevant research activities and the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic Ocean Data Portals fit into the data ecosystem now, and how those entities might play different roles once the data catalog is created.\n\nSubcommittee roles:\n\nIdentify issues around data flows, interoperability across platforms, and general data access for the DGSC to consider.\nUpdate and maintain documentation on data standards and preferred repositories and provide summaries to DGSC.\nSupport data partners in documenting data flows and identifying barriers and challenges.\n\n\n\n2 - Developing common policies, minimum data standards, and guidance for data management\n\nCommon policies\nRWSC participants expressed strong support for a common library of contract language and guidance on data licensing. While individual repositories may have their own licensing terms, including adding machine-readable license terms to datasets, the DGSC can look across these licensing terms in their repository review and highlight commonalities. Similarly, RWSC staff have already begun compiling data sharing and licensing terms from RWSC partners and from Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) like the MOU between RWSC and the Center for Ocean Leadership to administer research funding. The language library can help partners select the most appropriate terms for their data needs. The DGSC can also explore creating a basic data sharing policy that can be incorporated by reference in any contract.\n\n\nData standards and data management\n“Ensuring appropriate data and standards are in place to support science priorities” is part of the RWSC’s core purpose. At the September 2023 RWSC Data Governance workshop, participants were interested in common standards for: metadata across agencies, sectors, and groups; attribution; data management; data collection methods; long-term storage; and data quality. This is an area where there is a high degree of interest and expertise in the RWSC community, as well as strong opinions about the merits of different tools and approaches. Standardizing data and data processes has many benefits:\n\nReduced cost for funders of research: funders can reference standard practices rather than spending time detailing them in a scope of work or updating study requirements as science and research technologies advance.\nReduced cost/time for data collectors: researchers can use and cite standard practices rather than developing new protocols and avoid collecting unnecessary or incompatible data.\nEnsures a standard product: funders can be sure that they paid for “good” data that met a set of community-developed criteria; data can be used in future analyses.\nMore efficient science and management decision-making: access and analyses are faster which streamlines interpretation and use.\n\nThe RWSC will have the opportunity to set specific requirements for projects funded through the RWSC Offshore Wind & Wildlife Research Fund. Requirements should include explicit budgeting for data management (at least 10% of total project costs (Tanhua et al., 2019; Trice et al., 2021)), designation of a data manager who will be responsible for development of a data management and sharing plan, and seeing that data are appropriately documented and shared. The DGSC should lead the development of these requirements, including creating a data management and sharing plan template, starting with a review of existing programs to identify guidance and best practices.\nConsistent, complete metadata is the foundation of the offshore wind & wildlife data ecosystem and the ability to create an RWSC data catalog. Standardized metadata is part of the global best practice of making data FAIR — Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable — within the RWSC community and beyond (Tanhua et al., 2019; Wilkinson et al., 2016). FAIR principles are consistent with the RWSC’s core values of Transparency and Accessibility and not only support the Science Plan, but also support future re-use by new partners for questions not yet imagined (Hoeberling, 2022). In addition to the FAIR principles, the CARE principles for Indigenous data stewardship provide guidance for working with Indigenous knowledge and other information from communities while respecting data sovereignty and local control (Carroll et al., 2020). The RWSC should strive to achieve FAIR principles for all data and incorporate CARE principles as appropriate.\nMetadata standards and data standards are often prescribed by repositories. However, the DGSC will need to look across the recommended repositories to formulate a ‘minimum information standard’ that will ensure inclusion of useful information in the RWSC data catalog. This should not be a wholly new standard but a clear subset of components drawn from existing metadata standards recommended by the Subcommittees. For the data catalog, the RWSC may develop guidance and tools that explain and streamline metadata creation for new or undocumented data or utilize software that programmatically gleans existing metadata from data that are already published or archived in repositories.\nDGSC roles:\n\nReview the metadata and data standards for the repositories recommended by the Subcommittees.\nDevelop the minimum metadata set for the data catalog and facilitate review by Subcommittees.\nDevelop a data management and sharing plan template for RWSC-funded projects.\nCreate a basic data sharing policy that can be incorporated by reference in any contract.\n\nSubcommittee roles:\n\nEncourage and support RWSC participants to use the data repositories recommended by the Subcommittees.\nDevelop or encourage and support RWSC participants to use standard data collection templates/data sheets for each taxon or data type.\nInform the development of the DGSC data sharing and management template and adapt it to meet Subcommittee needs, data types, and data products.\n\n\n\n\n3 - Creating a Data Catalog\nData catalogs are detailed collections of metadata that make up a searchable inventory of datasets and products. The RWSC data catalog would connect the components of the offshore wind and wildlife data ecosystem and enable the discovery and sharing of data funded by the RWSC and partners in support of the Science Plan. With a robust data catalog, RWSC would function as a coordinator and information hub without having to store data or serve as a data repository. The Offshore Wind & Wildlife Research Database contains information at the project level, but a data catalog would operate at the dataset or data product level. It would pull descriptive metadata describing each dataset from the external repositories in the offshore wind and wildlife data ecosystem so that anyone could find and access it.\nThe minimum metadata set in Recommendation #2 will be needed for the catalog to operate, and the wind “identifier” described in Recommendation #1 could also assist in pulling in data from external repositories.\nDGSC roles:\n\nDevelop technical requirements for the catalog.\nReview and evaluate potential catalog hosts and technical infrastructure.\nRecommend options to the Steering Committee.\n\nSubcommittee roles:\n\nRecommend catalog hosting options.\n\n\n\n4 - Building network capacity to steward unique or orphaned data\nWhile this may not be a major focus for the DGSC, there are data types, such as large image files from aerial high-definition cameras or thermal cameras, that do not have an existing repository. For the RWSC and partners to be able to preserve this data for future use, the DGSC will need to investigate options for hosting the data. This could involve working with partners who manage or maintain existing data infrastructure to develop a solution. Having the RWSC procure and maintain its own hosting solution should be a last resort, due to the limited capacity of the organization.\nDGSC roles:\n\nAs requested, explore solutions for orphan data.\n\nSubcommittee roles:\n\nIdentify orphan datasets that need alternate hosting solutions.\nRecommend data standards and best practices for data documentation.\n\n\n\n5 - Providing general data governance support and education\nRWSC data partners and participants have a wide range of expertise and disciplinary backgrounds. This makes it important to develop shared language around data governance, data management, and participant expectations. The DGSC should explore creating a data handbook and glossary of key terms that helps anyone engage with the data ecosystem, whether they are agency managers, data scientists, biologists, or attorneys. The DGSC could also write up case studies and examples showing how data governance works from different partner perspectives and for different data types and workflows, helping make the concept of data governance more tangible. This type of community education will help develop consistency and shared understanding across the RWSC’s efforts and build the overall data capacity of the offshore wind and wildlife community."

    "text": "3.1 Data Management\nUnderstanding marine mammal movement and behavior near offshore wind developments will require close coordination among researchers, state and federal agencies, and industry. The Marine Mammal Subcommittee will work with individuals and entities who conduct research to ensure that data are collected and stored in consistent formats that allow comparisons and pooling across individual projects in the RWSC study area. This standardization is intended to support regional-scale assessments and the development and maintenance of regional data products and tools (e.g., marine mammal density models).\nTo support these efforts, the Marine Mammal Subcommittee recommends:\n\nMaintenance of an up-to-date resource list of recommended repositories, data and metadata standards, guidance, and protocols for use by all data collectors.

    "text": "3.2 Data Collection\nSeveral entities are requiring, funding, and/or advocating for marine mammal research and data collection activities with respect to offshore wind. Ongoing and planned activities, including marine mammal monitoring that is being required by agencies, are captured in the Offshore Wind & Wildlife Research Database.\nIndividuals and entities should consult with the Marine Mammal Subcommittee prior to collecting marine mammal data with respect to offshore wind to ensure that any new data collection does not duplicate existing efforts and is consistent with the tools and approaches already in use. Any individual or entity may join public Marine Mammal Subcommittee meetings by obtaining meeting links on the RWSC website.\nA combination of methods (visual, acoustic, tagging) is recommended to provide the most complete information and context to marine mammal observations, given the strengths and limitations of each method alone (see Appendix D for more information):\n\n(Cross taxa) Leveraging BOEM’s and NOAA’s ongoing efforts, ensure that the required Protected Species Observer data collected by offshore wind companies during construction and operations via Pile Driving Monitoring Plans and Vessel Strike Avoidance Plans (and any other mitigation plans) follows a consistent reporting approach and is eventually submitted to a Master Protected Species Observer Sightings Database for use in marine mammal analyses and research.\nEnsure that other marine mammal and environmental data collection required by the agencies during installation (e.g., sound fields, visual monitoring, PAM, thermal/infrared camera systems) are collected using consistent methods such that data can be used in other analyses and research including broader scale analyses of potential impacts across many projects.\n(Cross-taxa) Continue regional scale protected species and habitat data collection activities through the Atlantic Marine Assessment Program for Protected Species (AMAPPS), Ecosystem Monitoring Survey; NOAA Fisheries North Atlantic Right Whale Aerial Surveys, NOAA Fisheries Marine Mammal and Sea Turtle Aerial Surveys, NOAA Fisheries Marine Mammal, Sea Turtle, and Seabird ship-based surveys; NOAA Fisheries Seal aerial abundance surveys. Advance the NOAA Fisheries and BOEM Survey Mitigation Strategy (Hare et al., 2022) to ensure that site-specific and regional scale studies are put in the context of population trends and ecosystem conditions.\n(Cross-taxa) Coordinate regular high-definition aerial surveys that cover multiple lease areas using the same tools and methods. This effort should leverage the considerable amount of high-definition aerial photography data collected during site assessment by multiple offshore wind developers, and the Southern New England megafauna aerial surveys that have occurred consistently since 2011.\nContinue to support the adaptive design and implementation of a regional long-term archival passive acoustic monitoring network in the Atlantic Ocean and guide future research including:\n\nCharacterize baseline ambient sound and sound/noise during all phases of development, leveraging the regional passive acoustic monitoring network.\nExpand passive acoustic monitoring outside of wind energy areas, especially along the shelf break, including using gliders and real-time systems.\nTo the extent practicable, ensure alignment between archival and real-time deployments. Ensure that whale detections from real-time systems can be folded into analyses and data products that also leverage archival detections.\nIncorporate collection of oceanographic data and prey fields into the regional-scale PAM network.\nImprove estimates of acoustic detection rates and cue rates of baleen whales during non-construction conditions.\nImprove dose-response curves by obtaining in-situ behavioral data at offshore wind construction sites on baleen whale responses to pile driving noise. This would require collecting a range of data types including PAM and visual observations (aerial or ship-based).\nCouple aerial/visual monitoring with acoustic monitoring to address the issues above and better link the resulting observational datasets.\nCo-deploy acoustic telemetry receivers to build out a telemetry receiver network, and other sensors as practicable.\n\nCollect marine mammal behavioral and health data through tagging and visual observations to determine how individuals interact with wind farm structures and whether changes to foraging, socializing, or reproduction are occurring.\nIn collaboration with NOAA Fisheries, continue and expand stranding data collection and analysis with respect to strandings and mortality data time series analysis for the U.S. Atlantic Ocean.\nMonitor entanglement with subsea structure of floating offshore wind structures and monitor secondary entanglement where derelict fishing gear/marine debris may attach to subsurface offshore wind structures.\nAdvance oceanographic and biological data collection and use in marine mammal research.\n\nCoordinate with the North East Regional Association of Coastal and Ocean Observing Systems (NERACOOS), Mid-Atlantic Regional Association of Coastal Ocean Observing Systems (MARACOOS), and Southeastern Coastal Ocean Observing Regional Association (SECOORA).\nLeverage existing ocean observing platforms or add new ocean observing assets for marine mammal monitoring.\nWork with the Habitat & Ecosystem Subcommittee to ensure that key oceanographic and habitat data are collected and available as data products for use in marine mammal studies and as model covariates.\nWork with the Habitat & Ecosystem Subcommittee to determine whether offshore wind structures alter hydrodynamics, stratification, and mixing, and/or prey distribution and abundance.\nContinue to collect data across the region that allows analysis and synthesis of prey fields. Develop a coordinated regional scale zooplankton monitoring and mapping effort that builds off of and links existing surveys and studies including programs monitoring dimethyl sulfide, EcoMon, Continuous Plankton Recorder, the Gulf of Maine MBON, BOEM-funded Zooplankton Ecology study, Canadian AZMP, Center for Coastal Studies, Northeast U.S. Shelf LTER, and projects conducted by Stony Brook University and Rutgers University to establish a broader ecosystem observing system, synthesize patterns, and identify trends and linkages across trophic levels.\n\n\nThere is a need to advance technologies that improve marine mammal detection during all phases of offshore wind development, and to ensure that the performance of new technologies is evaluated consistently (see Chapter 10):\n\nDevelop, evaluate performance, and apply existing and emerging technologies that enhance marine mammal detection, including thermal cameras, infrared cameras, passive acoustics systems, and systems that integrate multiple methods for use during construction and operational monitoring and mitigation. Test “smart” mitigation methods triggered by marine mammal presence as determined by these systems.\nAdvance quieting technologies meant to mitigate construction noise (piledriving, vessel traffic) and operational noise (vessel traffic, operational vibratory sound).\nDevelop and deploy safe long-duration satellite tagging telemetry technology for tracking high-resolution movements of marine mammals in and around offshore wind structures.\nImprove analysis of monitoring data through artificial intelligence, automated acoustic, and image processing, and near real-time data availability.\n(Cross taxa) Develop and test eDNA assays/surveys/sampling regimes to understand efficacy of use developing indices of occurrence/abundance, including testing the effect of carcasses in the environment on eDNA detection.\n\nThe Gulf of Maine has long represented important feeding grounds for baleen whales from late fall to early spring (NOAA CetSound, 2015). A resident population of Harbor porpoise is present in the coastal/nearshore areas of the Gulf of Maine from July to September (NOAA CetSound, 2015). Almost all of the Gulf of Maine subregion is critical habitat (Northeastern U.S. foraging area) for North Atlantic right whales. Given that offshore wind development areas are still being identified in this subregion, baseline data collection should seek to characterize fine scale spatial and temporal habitat use. Studies of impacts specific to floating offshore wind (e.g., secondary entanglement), including modeling, should be coordinated through the Subcommittee. Cape Cod Bay, as a historical whale aggregation location, could serve as a sentinel site or control site to monitor potential population-level impacts to whales.\nIn Southern New England, known whale foraging hotspots (e.g., Nantucket Shoals) should be monitored using multiple methods to understand potential changes in behavior and habitat use. Studies of hydrodynamics and physical oceanography at the turbine- and wind farm-scales should seek to disentangle climate change drivers from offshore wind development and understand any changes that may impact whale prey (ACP, 2023; NASEM, 2023).\nWhale and dolphin sightings in the New York/New Jersey Bight have increased recently and includes increases in juvenile humpback whales in coastal waters, likely due to an increase in their menhaden prey. These whales may be particularly vulnerable to vessel strike due to their behavior and high density and speed of vessels in nearshore waters of this region (Stepanuk et al., 2021). Studies of whale-prey relationships and potential displacement from offshore wind areas in this region should be tailored to this context and capture rapidly changing ecosystem conditions and existing human uses in this area.\nThe U.S. Central Atlantic includes small resident populations of bottlenose dolphins, and large whales occur here and in the U.S. Southeast Atlantic at relatively lower densities than the other subregions. Data collection strategies and studies should be designed with the lower expected densities in mind. Both regions are important migratory routes, and the U.S. Southeast Atlantic contains critical habitat for North Atlantic right whale calving. More information is needed about the ways that reproductively active female right whales respond (or do not respond) to physical structures, noise, and vessels in their environment before wind projects are implemented in the Southeast right whale calving habitat. Characterizations of marine mammal distribution, abundance, and movement should continue in these subregions using multiple methods as offshore wind planning and development advances."

    "text": "3.3 Data Analysis\nData analyses should inform where new data collection is needed, characterize oceanographic and habitat drivers of marine mammal distribution, abundance, and behavior, seek to assess whether offshore wind is causing any observed changes, and evaluate the efficacy of monitoring and mitigation strategies. The Subcommittee is especially interested in studies that seek to distinguish between climate change-driven shifts in marine mammal distribution, abundance, and behavior and changes that may be driven by offshore wind construction and operation. Related changes of interest include:\n\nWhether construction activities displace or attract marine mammals\nWhether offshore wind structures displace or attract marine mammals\nWhether marine mammal feeding is altered due to changes to hydrodynamics or prey distribution/abundances caused by offshore wind structures\n\nIndividuals and entities should consult with the Marine Mammal Subcommittee prior to conducting analyses of marine mammal data with respect to offshore wind to ensure that the study leverages all of the available data and contributes to addressing the key recommendations described below to the extent possible:\n\nLeverage extensive existing and long-term data sources. These include but are not limited to AMAPPS, NOAA Fisheries North Atlantic Right Whale Aerial Surveys, Southern New England Aerial Megafauna Surveys, long-term/archival PAM, as well as shorter-duration observational studies (aerial, boat-based, tagging) as foundational elements of any analysis.\nConduct a synthetic baseline assessment of marine mammals over the past several decades to characterize pre-development levels of spatial and temporal variability in marine mammal distribution and abundance patterns, from which to measure and assess any potential changes after the onset of offshore wind construction and regional-scale operation activities. Integrate density modeling and/or visual survey data, passive acoustic monitoring data, tagging data, oceanography/habitat data, and climate data to characterize pre-development levels of spatial and temporal variability in marine mammal distribution and abundance patterns.\nContinue to update and improve marine mammal density models. Use outputs to understand drivers of marine mammal distribution and movement and to assess/detect change, displacement, and/or potential impacts. Periodically evaluate model performance and use validation and evaluation results to continually inform and advance model/framework development and applications.\n\nIntegrate the latest observational and environmental data every 2-3 years.\nIntegrate data from multiple additional methods (strandings, digital aerial surveys, passive acoustic data, tagging) and covariates (oceanographic and prey distribution). Apply results to inform research designs, determine baseline abundance/distribution estimates, best practices, etc.\nConsider how to structure future model “eras” to reflect offshore wind pre-construction and construction/operation.\nThe modeling framework should be scalable to individual projects and the whole region such that individual project-specific outputs could be pooled into regional-scale versions of the model.\n\nRepeat a power analysis to optimize the design of the long-term archival passive acoustic monitoring network every 3-5 years. Ensure that new monitoring assets and analysis results are accounted for and that existing or new hypotheses and questions can be addressed by the regional network.\nInform and evaluate the effectiveness of mitigation strategies meant to minimize impacts resulting from increases in vessel traffic (i.e., noise, collision, displacement) from construction and maintenance of offshore wind projects.\n\nDevelop or update existing vessel and marine mammal co-occurrence models with information from the offshore wind industry regarding vessel types and numbers. Validate models with AIS and effort-corrected whale sightings data.\nConduct studies to assess the effectiveness of mitigation strategies such as speed restrictions, establishment of traffic corridors, etc.\n\nModel and assess entanglement risks associated with floating offshore wind.\nBuild off Project WOW and apply lessons learned to studies in and around other lease areas outside Southern New England and New York/New Jersey Bight. Use Project WOW Frameworks to identify stressors, species, and geographic areas to conduct assessments of displacement, attraction, or other changes to wildlife abundance, distribution, behavior, and/or health.\nIntegrate multiple types of data (e.g., acoustic, visual, stable isotopes, bycatch estimates, vessel trip reports) to understand potential changes in marine mammal feeding behaviors.\nDetermine whether prey distribution, abundance and/or behavior is altered due to hydrodynamic changes caused by offshore wind structures and from EMF/cables (heat and electromagnetic field).\nScope studies of EMF and marine mammals. Include studies of whether animals can detect EMF, what the sensing capabilities are, and over what distance."
